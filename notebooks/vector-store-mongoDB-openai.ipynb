page_content='{\"question\": \"Have you ever bought a company where the numbers told you not to? How much is quantitative and how much is qualitative?\", \"answer\": \"The best buys have been when the numbers almost tell you not to. Because then you feel so strongly about the product. And not just the fact you are getting a used cigar butt cheap. Then it is compelling. I owned a windmill company at one time. Windmills are cigar butts, believe me. I bought it very cheap, I bought it at a third of working capital. And we made money out of it, but there is no repetitive money to be made on it. There is a one-time profit in something like that. And it is just not the thing to be doing. I went through that phase. I bought streetcar companies and all kinds of things. In terms of the qualitative, I probably understand the qualitative the moment I get the phone call. Almost every business we have bought has taken five or ten minutes in terms of analysis. We bought two businesses this year. General Re is a $18 billion deal. I have never been to their home office. I hope it is there. (Laughter) \\\\u201cThere could be a few guys there saying what numbers should we send Buffett this month?\\\\u201d I could see them going once a month and saying we have $20 billion in the bank instead of $18 billion.I have never been there. Before I bought Executive Jet, which is fractional ownership of jets, before I bought it, I had never been there. I bought my family a quarter interest in the program three years earlier. And I have seen the service and it seems to develop well. And I got the numbers. But if you don\\\\u2019t know enough to know about the business instantly, you won\\\\u2019t know enough in a month or in two months. You have to have sort of the background of understanding and knowing what you do or don\\\\u2019t understand. That is the key. It is defining your circle of competence. Everybody has got a different circle of competence. The important thing is not how big the circle is, the important thing is the size of the circle; the important thing is staying inside the circle. And if that circle only has 30 companies in it out of 1000s on the big board, as long as you know which 30 they are, you will be OK. And you should know those businesses well enough so you don\\\\u2019t need to read lots of work. Now I did a lot of work in the earlier years just getting familiar with businesses and the way I would do that is use what Phil Fisher would call, the \\\\u201cScuttlebutt Approach.\\\\u201d I would go out and talk to customers, suppliers, and maybe ex-employees in some cases. Everybody. Everytime I was interested in an industry, say it was coal, I would go around and see every coal company. I would ask every CEO, \\\\u201cIf you could only buy stock in one coal company that was not your own, which one would it be and why? You piece those things together, you learn about the business after awhile. Funny, you get very similar answers as long as you ask about competitors. If you had a silver bullet and you could put it through the head of one competitor, which competitor and why? You will find who the best guy is in the industry. So there are a lot of things you can learn about a business. I have done that in the past on the business I felt I could understand so I don\\\\u2019t have to do that anymore. The nice thing about investing is that you don\\\\u2019t have to learn anything new. You can do it if you want to, but if you learn Wrigley\\\\u2019s chewing gum forty years ago, you still understand Wrigley\\\\u2019s chewing gum. There are not a lot of great insights to get of the sort as you go along. So you do get a database in your head. I had a guy, Frank Rooney, who ran Melville for many years; his father-in-law died and had owned H.H. Brown, a shoe company. And he put it up with Goldman Sachs. But he was playing golf with a friend of mine here in Florida and he mentioned it to this friend, so my friend said \\\\u201cWhy don\\\\u2019t you call Warren?\\\\u201d He called me after the match and in five minutes I basically had a deal. But I knew Frank, and I knew the business. I sort of knew the basic economics of the shoe business, so I could buy it. Quantitatively, I have to decide what the price is. But, you know, that is either yes or no. I don\\\\u2019t fool a lot around with negotiations. If they name a price that makes sense to me, I buy it. If they don\\\\u2019t, I was happy the day before, so I will be happy the day after without owning it.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"What is it that really piques your interest in a stock?

You should be able to explain why you bought something in a paragraph.\\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t do DCF\\\\u201d (WB says he does a rough approximation in his mind)Finding ideas is a function of cumulative knowledge over time. Something just comes along - usually an event takes place, like a good management team screwing up that creates the opportunity (WB seems to imply here that his reading isn\\\\u2019t specifically targeted at finding ideas, but rather that ideas jump out at him as a natural consequence of vociferous reading)You must be patient...good ideas tend to be clustered together, and may not come at even time intervals...when you don\\\\u2019t find anything for a while it can be irritatingWB isn\\\\u2019t bothered by missing something outside his circle of competence -Missing things inside the circle is nerve racking...examples include WMT, FNM   [When asked about the relative attractiveness of bonds, arbitrage, etc., Buffett replied:] Charlie and I are competent to make judgments on certain things, and not other things.  We try to focus on what we can understand, which is a reasonable amount. In the summer to mid-fall of 2002, when junk bonds became very attractive, we bought a lot.  But we did not make a big decision to buy junk bonds \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s just that a lot of them got really cheap. We have an open mind \\\\u2013 whatever we see on a given day that overcomes our resistance to take risk, we\\\\u2019ll do.  Charlie and I do not have a checklist to prioritize categories.  I hope he gets a good idea, he hopes I have one and if we find one, then we move, hopefully in a big way.  It has to be big. We\\\\u2019re recently made big investments in currencies and viatical settlements.  We don\\\\u2019t do arbitrage any more because we\\\\u2019re too big. [CM: We have a lot of cash because we don\\\\u2019t like any of those fields at the moment.  Trying to prioritize among things we\\\\u2019re unlikely to do is pretty fruitless. - [Q - How do you get better at valuing companies?] WB: Very very good question. I started out not knowing anything about valuing companies. Ben Graham taught me a way to value certain type of business, but the selection of available companies dried up. Charlie taught me about durable competitive advantage. Not how big circle of competence is, but knowing where the edges are is most important. Think about businesses in your own home town. Ask questions about the businesses. Which do you want to buy into, which are hard to compete with, talk about businesses with people. What is working, what is not? You have to ask. You would be surprised at how many companies I know nothing about. The goal is to find companies that will be around for 20 years and offer a margin of safety. You have to recognize your limitations to be successful in this business. 6-7yrs ago I looked at Korean stocks, and I could see a number of businesses that met margin of safety. I bought 20 and diversified. CM: Obviously if you want to get good at something which is competitive, you have to think about it and practice a lot. You have to keep learning because world keepschanging and competitors keep learning. You have to go to bed wiser than you got up. As you try to master what you are trying to do \\\\u2013 people who do that almost never fail utterly. Very few have ever failed with that approach. You may rise slowly, but you are sure to rise. WB: When did you start valuing businesses? CM: I never took a business class, except accounting. When I was a boy, there was a man who came to the club every day at 10:30am. I asked my dad about him \\\\u2013 he had such a good life! My Dad said, \\\\u201cHe gathers up and renders dead horses.\\\\u201d I learned from that. Many businesses are sold under distress. Life is hard to get near top, and hard to hold position once attained. I think you could predict that Kiewits would win, they cared more. I would not have bet on anyone else. Half Dutch half German \\\\u2013 and that is coming from me, I\\\\u2019m named Munger. I was automatically doing it \\\\u2013 what was working and what wasn\\\\u2019t. If you have that temperament, you will gradually learn. If you don\\\\u2019t have that temperament, I can\\\\u2019t help you. WB: Avoiding the dumb things is the most important. Learn more, know limitations, avoid the dumb things. Charlie often thought about his client\\\\u2019s business. He was incapable of thinking about a business without noticing the fundamental economics. CM: I had a client who sold a Caterpillar dealership business for a crazy price to an oil business. The oil business had consultants and a concept and a strategy!\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"What\\'s your acquisition criteria? What has made you successful in this area where most others have failed?\", \"answer\": \"We look for people who have a passion for their business. We frequently buy businesses the owners still manage, where they are monetizing a lifetime of work. They often don\\\\u2019t want to sell but need to for estate planning or other reasons. They need to have a passion because we don\\\\u2019t have any employment contracts \\\\u2013 because we don\\\\u2019t think they work \\\\u2013 we don\\\\u2019t stand over them with whips, and they\\\\u2019re already rich. We just try not to kill or dampen their love for their business. We also look for three things: intelligence, energy and integrity. If you don\\\\u2019t have the latter, then you should hope they don\\\\u2019t have the first two either. If someone doesn\\\\u2019t have integrity, then you want them to be dumb and lazy. (Laughter) We look them in the eyes and ask, \\\\u201cDo they love the business or the money?\\\\u201d If someone wants to cash out, then we have a problem because we only have 16 people at Berkshire\\\\u2019s headquarters and can\\\\u2019t run it ourselves. Munger: The interesting thing is how well it [our acquisition strategy/process] has worked over a great many decades, and how few people copy it. (Laughter) We criticize it [acquisitions], but then we do it. But we have different motivations. We\\\\u2019ve been reasonably successful in having people run their businesses with the same passion as before we bought them. Gillette, the oil companies, etc. all went out and bought a lot of businesses and tried to run them themselves. We\\\\u2019re under no illusions that we can do that. We think that having lots of Executive Vice Presidents, directives from headquarters, centralized Human Resources etc. can destroy the incentives of the people who\\\\u2019ve already gotten rich, and we\\\\u2019re counting on them making us rich. The successor to me will come from Berkshire, knows our system, has seen that it works, and will be surrounded by people who believe in it. So it\\\\u2019s not going to be so hard to keep this train going down the tracks at 90 miles per hour. [CM: Our success has come from the lack of oversight we\\\\u2019ve provided, and our success will continue to be from a lack of oversight. (Laughter) But if you\\\\u2019re going to provide minimal oversight, you have to buy carefully. It\\\\u2019s a different model from GE\\\\u2019s. GE\\\\u2019s works \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s just very different from ours.] We are a conglomerate \\\\u2013 and we hope to become more of a conglomerate. We\\\\u2019re successful because of simplicity itself: We let people who play the game very well keep doing it. Our successor won\\\\u2019t change this. The big worry is that the culture is tampered with and there\\\\u2019s oversteering. But our board and owners won\\\\u2019t allow this. - [BRK2006 - Update on acquistions] Russell is in process \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019ll probably be a couple of months before completion. I described the Business Wire acquisition in the annual report. I got a letter from Cathy [Baron Tamraz, CEO of Business Wire]. [Regarding the purchase of GE\\\\u2019s Medical Protective Corporation,] I knew [GE CEO Jeff] Immelt wanted to shed some insurance assets and I suggested we\\\\u2019d be interested in that part of it, so we talked and made a deal. One thing we haven\\\\u2019t done is participate in auctions. I get books occasionally and the projections are just plain silly. Maybe that\\\\u2019s why they don\\\\u2019t sign them. I\\\\u2019d love to make a bet with the investment bankers about whether the companies achieve the earnings in the pitch books. The calls we want to get are from people who care about their business, who for tax or family-ownership reasons want to sell to us. They\\\\u2019re looking to change the ownership structure, not the operating personality and culture of the company they care deeply about. The owners of Iscar are keeping 19% [I think he meant 20%]. They think [Berkshire] is the best place for their business and their people, and where they\\\\u2019ll have the most opportunity to grow. I don\\\\u2019t know how many stories you read about a $4 billion deal that doesn\\\\u2019t say anything about an investment banker on either side. [CM: The interesting thing about it to me is the mindset. With all these \\\\u201chelpers\\\\u201d running around, they talk about doing deals. We talk about welcoming partners. The guy doing deals, he wants to do a deal and then unwind it in the near future. It\\\\u2019s totally opposite for us. We like to build lasting relationships. I think our system will work better in the long term than flipping deals. I think there are so many of them [helpers] that they\\\\u2019ll get in each other\\\\u2019s way. I don\\\\u2019t think they\\\\u2019ll make enough money to meet their expectations, by flipping, flipping, flipping.] By charging fees, fees, fees. [Laughter] [CM: Warren talked to guy at an investment bank and asked how they made their money. He said, \\\\u201cOff the top, off the bottom, off both sides and in the middle.\\\\u201d [Laughter]] [A shareholder asked if he\\\\u2019d be interested in buying Oriental Trading Company, a direct marketer of novelties and gift items, which is based in Omaha.] I looked at Oriental Trading a few years ago. I didn\\\\u2019t know it was for sale again. I don\\\\u2019t know, but I suspect some private group bought it and is now selling it. We see that all the time. They invariably try to sell it quickly to a strategic buyer, which is another way of saying someone who pays too much. Anytime someone calls me and says we\\\\u2019d be a logical strategic buyer, I hang up the phone faster than Charlie would. The idea that we\\\\u2019re going to find a business to buy from a guy who\\\\u2019s been thinking from the moment he bought only about how he\\\\u2019s going to spruce it up and get out, is very low. It\\\\u2019s Fund A selling to Fund B to Fund C. The irony is that the same pension fund may be invested in all three funds, so they\\\\u2019re just paying all of the money managers to flip it to one another. [CM: In the 1930s, there was a stretch where you could borrow more against the real estate than you could sell it for. I think that\\\\u2019s what\\\\u2019s going on in today\\\\u2019s private- equity world.]\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"What\\'s your acquisition strategy? How do you get deals?\", \"answer\": \"We\\'d like to keep buying businesses like the eight we bought last year. Our first preference has always been to buy outstanding operating businesses outright. We\\'ve made money in stocks, especially in the 1970s, but the climate is not so favorable now. There are enough businesses that meet our criteria to do two acquisitions per year on average. What we\\'d really like to do is a $10-15 billion acquisition, but it\\'s hard to find one that\\'s not being auctioned, which we don\\'t do. We haven\\'t had much luck buying businesses overseas, but that\\'s because our phone hasn\\'t rung. We\\'re not on the radar screen, but we\\'re hoping this will change. Our best source of deals is word of mouth, generally in industries we\\'re invested in. Sort of like NetJets, where 70% of our new customers are referred by current customers. - It\\\\u2019s important to note that in this world where many businesses get dressed up and auctioned off, we occasionally hear from people who consider their business too important to auction off. We don\\\\u2019t participate in auctions. I can\\\\u2019t recall buying a business at auction, can you Charlie? [CM: I can\\\\u2019t remember one.] People who won\\\\u2019t put their business up for auction like a piece of meat and care about the home in which their business resides are the type of people we want to be partners with. It says something very important about how much they care about their business, their customers and their employees. We\\\\u2019ve acquired a number of businesses like this in the past couple of years and the crowning one is Iscar. I\\\\u2019m going to Israel in September to see if there are any more girls like Iscar there. [Tilson Notes - I think the Iscar acquisition is fantastic news for three reasons: 1.It\\\\u2019s big \\\\u2013 at $4 billion, it\\\\u2019s the 3rd-largest deal Buffett has ever done);2. It appears to be an awesome business. According to an article in an Israeli newspaper, Iscar was valued at $800 million in 1997, so it\\\\u2019s increased in value by more than 6x in nine years (that\\\\u2019s 22.6% compounded annually); and3.It\\\\u2019s the first business Buffett\\\\u2019s ever bought that is headquartered overseas. This is a huge step forward in expanding his hunting ground to the entire world for the \\\\u201celephants\\\\u201d he\\\\u2019s seeking. Having lived and traveled all over the world, I know that there are many fabulous, privately held businesses like Iscar, and Berkshire is the perfect buyer for many of them.] \"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Deal Flow?\", \"answer\": \"We don\\'t like the term \\\\\"deal flow\\\\\" because we don\\'t view them [businesses we might buy] as deals. We look at deals a few times a year. In the US, we get a pretty reasonable percentage of the calls we should get. We didn\\'t get those calls 20-40 years ago because we weren\\'t as well known. It feeds on itself. If we acquire companies and people say good things, we\\'ll hear from more. We acquired one furniture company, which led to four more. It\\'s like a snowball. By being around 38 years, it\\'s been a high mountain [and Berkshire is now a] big snowball and attracts a lot of snow. Outside the US, we don\\'t see many deals because we\\'re not as well known. I don\\'t hear about one [deal] a week or even a month. But most we want to hear about, we get a good percentage of the calls. It would be a plus [if we were to see more deals] outside this country. [CM: The general assumption is that it must be easy to sit behind a desk and people will bring in one good opportunity after another  this was the attitude in venture capital until a few years ago. This was not the case at all for us  we scrounged around for companies to buy. For 20 years, we didn\\'t buy more than one or two per year.] We didn\\'t have the money to do many deals.

Buffett: Charlie and I have made money in a lot of different ways, some of which we didn\\\\u2019t anticipate 30-40 years ago. You can\\\\u2019t have a defined roadmap, but you can have a reservoir of thinking, looking at markets in different places, different securities, etc. The key is that we knew what we didn\\\\u2019t know. We just kept looking. We knew during the Long Term Capital Management crisis that there would be a lot of opportunities, so we just had to read and think eight to ten hours a day. We needed a reservoir of experience. We won\\\\u2019t spot every one, though \\\\u2013 we\\\\u2019ve missed all kinds of things. But you need something in the way you\\\\u2019re programmed so you don\\\\u2019t lose a lot of money. Our best ideas haven\\\\u2019t done better than others\\\\u2019 best ideas, but we\\\\u2019ve lost less. We\\\\u2019ve never gone two steps forward and then one step back \\\\u2013 maybe just a fraction of a step back. Munger: And of course the place to look when you\\\\u2019re young is the inefficient markets. You shouldn\\\\u2019t be trying to guess if one drug company is going to have a better pipeline than another. Buffett: You should do well in games with few other players. The RTC [Resolution Trust Corporation] was a great example of a chance to make a lot of money. Here was a seller [government bureaucrats] with hundreds of billions of dollars of real estate and no money in the game, who wanted to wrap up quickly, while many buyers had no money and had been burned. There won\\\\u2019t be any scarcity of opportunity in your life, although there will be times when you feel that way. -  Don\\\\u2019t worry too much about your mistakesDon\\\\u2019t learn too much from your mistakes:Don\\\\u2019t become Mark Twain\\\\u2019s cat that never sat again on a stove after being burnedBUT...never be willing to play a \\\\u201cfatal\\\\u201d gameDon\\\\u2019t confuse social progress with the chance to make money \\\\u2013 look at airlines and autos for examplesLaw degree is not essential, but good if you think it will help in your specific careerLearning to think like a lawyer is a valuable traitAllocate even more of your day to reading than he doesRead lots of K\\\\u2019s and Q\\\\u2019s \\\\u2013 there are no good substitutes for these - Read every pageAsk business managers the following question: \\\\u201cIf you could buy the stock of one of your competitors, which one would you buy?

They were affected in a significant way by Charlie and Phil Fisher in terms of looking at better businesses.  And I\\\\u2019ve learned more about how businesses operate over time. You need an intellectual framework, which you can get mostly from  The Intelligent Investor.  Then, think about businesses you can get your mind around if you really work at it.  Then, you will do well if you have the right temperament. [CM: I\\\\u2019ve watched Warren for decades.  Warren has learned a lot.  He can pooh pooh investing in PetroChina, but he\\\\u2019s learned, which has allowed him to [expand his circle of competence so he could invest in something like PetroChina. If you don\\\\u2019t keep learning, other people will pass you by. Temperament alone won\\\\u2019t do it \\\\u2013 you need a lot of curiosity for a long, long time.] - It\\\\u2019s hard for individual investors to successfully pick stocks or time the market. The best investment you can make is in your own abilities. Anything you can do to develop your own abilities or business is likely to be more productive than investing in foreign currencies. If you own your own business in America [and you run it well, you\\\\u2019ll do OK]. When I was seven years old, I first took an interest in stocks. My dad was in the business, so I\\\\u2019d go with him to the office and I saw interesting things. [When I was a little older,] I went to the library and read every book on markets and investing. When I was 11, I bought my first stock \\\\u2013 three shares. I was following charts. When I was 19, I read The Intelligent Investor and it changed my whole framework. My advice is to read a lot. There are no secrets in the business that only the priesthood knows. It\\\\u2019s all right there. It requires qualities of temperament way more than qualities of intellect. Once you have a 125 IQ, much more doesn\\\\u2019t matter. Look for opportunities that fit your framework. Try to learn every day, but you can\\\\u2019t act every day. It\\\\u2019s important to enjoy the game, just as it is to enjoy bridge or baseball [if you\\\\u2019re going to play those games seriously]. - Ben Graham said you\\\\u2019re neither right nor wrong if you\\\\u2019re investing with the crowd \\\\u2013 you\\\\u2019re right if your facts and reasoning are right. Once you have the facts,youhave to think about what they mean. You don\\\\u2019t take a survey. You should focus on what\\\\u2019s important and knowable. There are many things that are important but now knowable, like [whether there will be] a nuclear attack tomorrow. You can\\\\u2019t focus on those. As Ben Graham said in chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor: The market is there to serve you, not instruct you. If it does something silly, it gives you a chance to do something. It just sets prices. If it doesn\\\\u2019t give you an opportunity, go play bridge and come back the next day. And the nice thing is that the prices will be different. During the Long-Term Capital Management crisis, we were getting calls on Sunday from people. By the way, you can make a lot of money on calls on Sunday \\\\u2013 that means things are really screwed up. Just make sure you\\\\u2019re the callee and not the caller. At that time, there was [an unprecedented] 30 basis point spread between on- versus off-the-run 30-year Treasuries. All you have to do [in such situations] is make sure you can play out your hand under all circumstances. If you can and you have the right facts \\\\u2013 and you let the market serve rather than instruct you \\\\u2013 you can\\\\u2019t miss. Munger: I\\\\u2019d say some of you probably can miss.

Investors have to remember: corporate profits are going up, but stocks are going up faster. How can that continue indefinitely? Investors can only earn what companies themselves can earn; the government or the markets themselves don\\\\u2019t kick anything in. How can you get anything more out of a farm than what it grows? There\\\\u2019s nothing magical added by the stock market to corporate returns. It just doesn\\\\u2019t create more earnings to pay out to investors.

We don\\\\u2019t know which will be super-winners, but we think a significant number will do okay. We don\\\\u2019t buy businesses with much thought of world trends, but we do think about businesses subject to foreign competition, with high labor content and a product that can be shipped in. I bought into an airline [US Air] with high seat-mile costs of 12 cents. It was protected, but that was before Southwest showed up with 8-cent costs. The variables you name don\\\\u2019t bother us. We have good businesses, deal from strength, always have a loaded gun and have the right managers and people and an owner-oriented culture. Munger: We learned about foreign labor competition in our shoe business. It reminds me of Will Rogers, who said he didn\\\\u2019t think man should have to learn easy lessons in such a hard fashion.

My advice is either start very early or live very long. I guess I\\\\u2019d do it the same way: maybe I\\\\u2019d start with small companies and buy good businesses. Or little pieces of \\\\u0091\\\\u2018em called stocks. [CM: The first $100,000 is probably the hardest part. Staying rational and significantly underspending your income helps, too.] - If we were to do it over again, we\\\\u2019d do it pretty much the same way.  The world hasn\\\\u2019t changed that much.  We\\\\u2019d read everything in sight about businesses and industries we think we\\\\u2019d understand.  And, working with far less capital, our investment universe would be far broader than it is currently. There\\\\u2019s nothing different, in my view, about analyzing securities today vs. 50 years ago. - We formed our first partnership 50 years and two days ago, on May 4, 1956, with $105,000. If we were starting again, Charlie would say we shouldn\\\\u2019t be doing this, but if we were, we\\\\u2019d be investing in securities around the world. Charlie would say we couldn\\\\u2019t find 20, but we don\\\\u2019t need 20 \\\\u2013 we only need a few that can pay off very big. We\\\\u2019d also be buying [stocks in] smaller companies. If we were planning to buy [entire] businesses, we\\\\u2019d have a tough time. We\\\\u2019d have no reputation and only $1 million. Charlie started out in real-estate development because with only a little capital, brain power and energy, you could magnify the returns in real estate unlike in other sectors. I\\\\u2019d just do it one foot in front of the other over time. But the basic principles wouldn\\\\u2019t be different. If I\\\\u2019d been running a little partnership three years ago, I\\\\u2019d have started out 100% in Korea. Munger: You should find something to invest in and then compare everything else against that. That\\\\u2019s your opportunity cost. That\\\\u2019s what you learn in freshman economics, even if it hasn\\\\u2019t made it into modern portfolio theory. That\\\\u2019s why modern portfolio theory is so asinine. Buffett: It really is. Munger: When Warren said he\\\\u2019d put 100% of his fund in Korea, maybe he wouldn\\\\u2019t quite do that, but pretty much. Most people won\\\\u2019t find a lot of great things [to invest in]. Instead, you\\\\u2019ll want to find a few things that are much better than anything else. Act on these.  [RE: How Buffett Would Invest with a Small Amount of Money] If I were working with a very small sum \\\\u2013 you all should hope this doesn\\\\u2019t happen \\\\u2013 I\\\\u2019d be doing almost entirely different things than I do. Your universe expands \\\\u2013 there are thousands of times as many options if you\\\\u2019re investing $10,000 rather than $100 billion, other than buying entire businesses. You can earn very high returns with very small amounts of money. Everyone can\\\\u2019t do it, but if you know what you\\\\u2019re doing, you can do it. We cannot earn phenomenal returns putting $3, $4 or $5 billion in a stock. It won\\\\u2019t work \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s not even close. If Charlie and I had $500,000 or $2 million to invest, we\\\\u2019d find little things we could do, not all of it in stocks. Munger: But there\\\\u2019s no point in our thinking about that now.  You have to find your passion in life. I would choose the same job. I enjoy it. It is a terrible mistake to sleepwalk through your life. Unless Shirley MacLaine is right, you won\\\\u2019t have another one. My dad had a business with [investment] books on his shelves, and they turned me on. This was before Playboy. If he was a minister, I\\\\u2019m not sure I would have been as enthused. If you have obligations, you have to deal with realities. I tell students to go work for an organization you admire or an individual you admire, which usually means that most MBAs I meet become self-employed. [laughter] I went to work for Ben Graham. I never asked my salary. Get the right spouse. Charlie talks about the man who spent twenty years looking for the perfect woman and found her. Unfortunately, she was looking for the perfect man. If you are lucky, you will be happy and as a result, you will behave better. It makes it easier. CM: You\\\\u2019ll do better if you have passion for something in which you have aptitude. If Warren had gone into ballet, no one would have heard of him. WB: Or would have heard of me very differently. [laughter]  [Q - With small sums of money, what strategies would you pursue?] WB: If I were working with small sums of money, it would open up thousands of possibilities. We have found very mispriced bonds. We found them in Korea a few years ago. You could make big returns but had to be of small size. I wouldn\\\\u2019t be in currencies with a small amount of money. I had a friend who used to buy tax liens. I\\\\u2019d look in small stocks or specialized bonds. Wouldn\\\\u2019t you say that, Charlie? CM: Sure.  [Q - If you were starting a $26 million fund, what would you do differently with a smaller asset base? How many positions would you hold, and what kind of turnover would you have? What would you do if some investments lost 50% and some gained?] Buffett: We would hold the half-dozen stocks we liked best. We would do the same thing if they lost 50%. Cost has nothing to do with it. We look at price and think about what something is worth. Keep it in the few you know. Munger: He [Buffett] has tactfully suggested you adopt a different way of thinking. [laughter] [Comment: As Buffett stated, cost basis has nothing to do with investment judgment (apart from tax considerations).

In fact, we are still earning those types of returns on some of our smaller investments. The best decade was the 1950s; I was earning 50% plus returns with small amounts of capital. I could do the same thing today with smaller amounts. It would perhaps even be easier to make that much money in today\\'s environment because information is easier to access. You have to turn over a lot of rocks to find those little anomalies. You have to find the companies that are off the map - way off the map. You may find local companies that have nothing wrong with them at all. A company that I found, Western Insurance Securities, was trading for $3/share when it was earning $20/share!! I tried to buy up as much of it as possible. No one will tell you about these businesses. You have to find them. Other examples: Genesee Valley Gas, public utility trading at a P/E of 2, GEICO, Union Street Railway of New Bedford selling at $30 when $100/share is sitting in cash, high yield position in 2002. No one will tell you about these ideas, you have to find them. The answer is still yes today that you can still earn extraordinary returns on smaller amounts of capital. For example, I wouldn\\'t have had to buy issue after issue of different high yield bonds. Having a lot of money to invest forced Berkshire to buy those that were less attractive. With less capital, I could have put all my money into the most attractive issues and really creamed it. I know more about business and investing today, but my returns have continued to decline since the 50\\'s. Money gets to be an anchor on performance. At Berkshire\\'s size, there would be no more than 200 common stocks in the world that we could invest in if we were running a mutual fund or some other kind of investment business.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Do you believe that we\\'ll have significant mispricings again?

In 1998, people behaved like frightened cavemen (referring to the Long Term Capital Management meltdown). People make their own opportunities. They will be frozen by fear, excited by greed and it doesn\\\\u2019t matter what their IQ, degrees etc is. Growth of 50% per year is with small capitalization, not large cap. The point is I got rich looking for stock with strong earnings. The last 50 years weren\\\\u2019t unique. It\\\\u2019s just capitalizing on human behavior. It\\\\u2019s people that make opportunities when others are frozen by fear or excited by greed. Human behavior allows for success if you are able to detach yourself emotionally. In 1951, I got out of school at 20 years old. At the time there were two publishers of stock information, Moody\\\\u2019s and Standards and Poor\\\\u2019s. I used Moody\\\\u2019s and went through every manual. I recently bought a copy of the 1951 Moody off of Amazon. On page 1433, there\\\\u2019s a stock you could have made some money on. The EPS was $29 and the Price Range was from $3-$21/share. On another page, there is a company that had an EPS of $29.5 and the price range was $27-28, 1x earnings. You can get rich finding things like this, things that aren\\\\u2019t written about. A couple of years ago I got this investment guide on Korean stocks. I began looking through it. It felt like 1974 all over again. Look here at this company...Dae Han, I don\\'t know how you pronounce it, it\\\\u2019s a flour company. It earned 12,879 won previously. It currently had a book value of 200,000 won and was earning 18,000 won. It had traded as high as 43,000 and as low as 35,000 won. At the time, the current price was 40,000 or 2 times earnings. In 4 hours I had found 20 companies like this. The point is nobody is going to tell you about these companies. There are no broker reports on Dae Han Flour Company. When you invest like this, you will make money. Sure 1 or 2 companies may turn out to be poor choices, but the others will more than make up for any losses. Not all of them will be good, but some will and those will make you rich. And this didn\\\\u2019t happen in 1932, this was in 2004! These opportunities will be there in the next 30 years. You\\\\u2019ll have streaks where you\\\\u2019ll find some bad companies and a few times where you\\\\u2019ll make money with everything that you do. The Wall Street analysts are brilliant people; they are better at math, but we know more about human nature. In your investing life you will have several opportunities and one or two that can\\\\u2019t go wrong. For example, in 1998 the NY fed offered a 30-year treasury bonds yielding less then the 29-\\\\u00bd year treasury bonds by 30 basis points. What happened was LTCM put a trade on at 10 basis points and it was a crowded trade, they were 100% certain to make money but they could not afford any hiccups.

In regards to the financial information and the business overall what factors do you look at?] We make quick decisions because we have filters before we get to the point of making a decision. Filter #1 \\\\u2013 Can we understand the business? What will it look like in 10-20 years? Take Intel vs. chewing gum or toilet paper. We invest within our circle of competence. Jacob\\\\u2019s Pharmacy created Coke in 1886. Coke has increased per capita consumption every year it has been in existence. It\\\\u2019s because there is no taste memory with soda. You don\\\\u2019t get sick of it. It\\\\u2019s just as good the 5th time of the day as it was the 1st time of the day. Filter #2 \\\\u2013 Does the business have a durable competitive advantage? This is why I won\\\\u2019t buy into a hula-hoop, pet rock, or a Rubik\\\\u2019s cube company. I will buy soft drinks and chewing gum. This is why I bought Gillette and Coke. Filter #3 \\\\u2013 Does it have management I can trust? Filter #4 \\\\u2013 Does the price make sense? Since 1972 we have made no change in the marketing, process etc. Take See\\\\u2019s candy. You cannot destroy the brand of See\\\\u2019s candy. Only See\\\\u2019s can do that. You have to look at the brand as a promise to the customer that we are going to offer the quality and service that is expected. We link the product with happiness.

Graham distinguished between the defensive and the enterprising and that.  So if you are going to spend a lot of time on investment, you know I just advise looking at as many things as possible and you will find some bargains.  And when you find them, you have to act.  It doesn\\'t  it hasn\\'t changed at all since I was here in 1950, 1951.  And it won\\'t change the rest of my life.  You start turning pages.  When I got out of school, I turned every page in Moody\\'s 10,000-some pages twice, looking for companies.  And you have to find them yourself.  The world isn\\'t going to tell you about great deals.  You have to find them yourself.  And that takes a fair amount of time.  So if you are not going to do that, if you are just going to be a passive investor, then I just advise an index fund more consistently over a long period of time.   The one thing I will tell you is the worst investment you can have is cash.  Everybody is talking about cash being king and all that sort of thing.  Most of you don\\'t look like you are overburdened with cash anyway. Cash is going to become worth less over time.  But good businesses are going to become worth more over time.  And you don\\'t want to pay too much for them so you have to have some discipline about what you pay.  But the thing to do is find a good business and stick with it. [Becky - Does that mean you think we are through the roughest times?  You had always kept the cash word around, too.] We always keep enough cash around so I feel very comfortable and don\\'t worry about sleeping at night.  But it\\'s not because I like cash as an investment.  Cash is a bad investment over time.  But you always want to have enough so that nobody else can determine your future essentially.  The worst  the financial panic is behind us.  The economic spillout which came to some extent from that financial panic is still with us.  It will end.  I don\\'t know if it will end tomorrow or next week or next month.  Or maybe a year.  But it won\\'t go on forever.  And to sit around and try and pick the bottom, people were trying to do that last March and the bottom hadn\\'t come in unemployment and the bottom hadn\\'t come in business but the bottom had come in stocks.  Don\\'t pass up something that\\'s attractive today because you think you will find something way more attractive tomorrow.  We have $16 billion in cash not because of any predictions [about a market decline], but because we can\\'t find anything that makes us want to part with that cash. We\\'re not positioning ourselves. We just try to do smart things every day, and if there\\'s nothing smart, then we sit on cash.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"What impacts have Graham/Dodd and Phil Fisher had on your investment philosophy? What percentage of your investment philosophy would you attribute to each of them?\", \"answer\": \"Well, good things would have happened with following either party. Graham obviously had more influence on me than Phil. I worked for Ben, I went to school under him, and his three basic ideas: look at stocks as businesses; have a proper attitude toward the market; and operate with a margin of safetythey all come straight from Graham. Phil Fisher opened my eyes a little more toward trying to find a wonderful business. Charlie did more of that than Phil did, but Phil was espousing that entirely, and I read his books in the early 60s. Phil\\'s still alive, and I owe Phil a lot, but Ben was one of a kind. [CM:\\\\u00a0 Ben Graham was a truly formidable mind, and he also had a clarity in writing, and we talk over and over again about the power of a few simple ideas thoroughly assimilated, and that happened with Graham\\'s ideas which came to me indirectly through Warren, but some also directly from Graham. The interesting thing for me is that Buffett the former prot\\\\u00e9g\\\\u00e9by the way Buffett was the best student Graham had in 30 years of teaching at Columbiabecame better than Graham. That\\'s the natural outcomeas Milton said, \\\\\"If I\\'ve seen a little farther than other men, it\\'s by standing on the shoulders of giants.\\\\\" So, Warren stood on Ben\\'s shoulders, but he ended up seeing more than Ben. No doubt somebody will come along and do a lot better than we have.] I enjoyed making money more than Ben. With Ben it really was incidental, at least by the time I knew him. The process, the whole game, didn\\'t interest him more than a dozen other things may have interested him. With me, I just find it interesting, and therefore I\\'ve spent a much higher percentage of my timing thinking about investing, and thinking about businesses.

His investing philosophy is still alive and well. There are disciples of him around, but all we are doing is parroting. I did read Phil Fisher later on, which showed the more qualitative aspects of businesses. Common stocks are part of a business. Markets are there to serve you, not to instruct you. You can often find a couple of companies that are out of line. Find one; get rich. Most people think that what the stock does from day to day contains information, but it doesn\\'t. It isn\\'t just something that wiggles around. The stock market is the best game in the world. You can take advantage of people who have no morals. High prices inside of a year will typically be 100% of the low price. Businesses don\\'t change in value that much. That is simply crazy. There are extreme degrees of fluctuation, and Mr. Market will call out the prices. Wait until he is nutty in one direction or the other. Put in a margin of safety. Don\\'t find a bridge that says no more than 10,000 pounds when you have a 9800 pound vehicle. It isn\\'t a function of IQ, but receptivity of the mind. When investing you don\\'t have to invest in all 10,000 companies available, you just have to find the one that is out of line. Mr. Market is your servant. Mr. Market is your partner and wants to sell the business to you everyday. Some days he is very optimistic and wants a high price, others he is pessimistic and will sell at a low price. You have to use this to your advantage. The market is the greatest game in the world. There is nothing else that can, at times, get this far out of line with reality. For example, land usually only fluctuates within a 15% band. Negotiated transactions are less volatile. Some get this; others don\\'t. Just keep your wits about you and you can make a lot of money in the market.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"If you were to teach an investment course, besides works by Ben Graham and Phil Fisher and your book on the instalment basis, what would be on the syllabus?\", \"answer\": \"[Q - how would you teach the next generation of investors?] Buffett: I had 49 university groups, in clumps of six, [visit me] last year. [An education in] investing requires only two courses: How to Value a Business, and How to Think About Markets. You don\\\\u2019t have to know how to value all businesses. Start with a small circle of competence, things you can understand. [Look for] things that are selling for less than they\\\\u2019re worth. Forget about things you can\\\\u2019t understand. You need to understand accounting, which has enormous limitations. [You need to] understand when a competitive advantage is durable or fleeting. Learn that the market is there to serve you, not instruct you. In the investing business, if you have an IQ of 150, sell 30 points to someone else. You do not need to be a genius. You need to have emotional stability, inner peace and be able to think for yourself, [since] you\\\\u2019re subjected to all sorts of stimuli.

If the market closed for years, we wouldn\\'t care. Would still keep making Sees candy, Dilly bars, etc. If you focus on the price, you\\'re assuming that the market knows more than you do. That may be the truth, but in that case you shouldn\\'t own it. The stock market is there to serve you, not to instruct you. Focus on price and value. If a stock gets cheaper and you have some cash, buy more. We sometimes stop buying when prices goes up. This cost us $8 billion a few years ago when we were buying Wal-Mart. When we\\'re buying something, we want the price to go down and down and down. You don\\'t have to be right on everything or 20%, 10%, or 5% of businesses. You only have to be right one or two times a year. I used to handicap horses. You can come up with a very profitable decision on a single company. If someone asked me to handicap the 500 companies in the S&P 500, I wouldn\\'t do a very good job. You only have to be right a few times in your lifetime, as long as you don\\'t make any big mistakes. [CM: What\\'s funny is that most big investment organizations don\\'t think like this. They hire lots of people, evaluate Merck vs. Pfizer and every stock in the S&P 500, and think they can beat the market. You can\\'t do it. Very few people have adopted our approach.] Ted Williams, in his book The Science of Hitting, talked about how he carved up the strike zone into different zones and only swung at pitches that were in his sweet spot. Investing is the same way.  [CM: We read a lot.  I don\\\\u2019t know anyone who\\\\u2019s wise who doesn\\\\u2019t read a lot.

It is the same way I fell about people who buy Berkshire. I want people who buy Berkshire to plan to hold it forever.

And if we ever found a huge acquisition, then maybe we would have to sell something. Maybe to make that acquisition but that would be a very pleasant problem to have. We never buy something with a price target in mind. We never buy something at 30 saying if it goes to 40 we\\\\u2019ll sell it or 50 or 60 or 100. We just don\\\\u2019t do it that way. Anymore than when we buy a private business like See\\\\u2019s Candy for $25 million. We don\\\\u2019t ever say if we ever get an offer of $50 million for this business we will sell it.

Over the past 50-60 years, Charlie and I have never permanently lost more than 2% of our personal worth on a position. We\\\\u2019ve suffered quotational loss, 50% movements. That\\\\u2019s why you should never borrow money. We don\\\\u2019t want to get into situations where anyone can pull the rug out from under our feet. In stocks, it\\\\u2019s the only place where when things go on sale, people get unhappy. If I like a business, then it makes sense to buy more at 20 than at 30. If McDonalds reduces the price of hamburgers, I think it\\\\u2019s great. - The question is about diversification. I have a dual answer to that. If you are not a professional investor. If your goal is not to manage money to earn a significantly better return than the world, then I believe in extreme diversification. I believe 98% - 99% who invest should extensively diversify and not trade, so that leads them to an index fund type of decision with very low costs. All they are going to do is own part of America. And they have made a decision that owning a part of America is worthwhile.I don\\\\u2019t quarrel with that at all. That is the way they should approach it unless they want to bring an intensity to the game to make a decision and start evaluating businesses. Once you are in the businesses of evaluating businesses and you decide that you are going to bring the effort and intensity and time involved to get that job done, then I think diversification is a terrible mistake to any degree. I got asked that question the other day at SunTrust. If you really know businesses, you probably shouldn\\\\u2019t own more than six of them. If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is gotta be a terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their best idea. So I would say for anyone working with normal capital who really knows the businesses they have gone into, six is plenty, and I probably have half of what I like best. I don\\\\u2019t diversify personally. All the people I\\\\u2019ve known that have done well with the exception of Walter Schloss, Walter diversifies a lot. I call him Noah, he has two of everything. - [Q - How do you get confident enough with that [smaller] level of diversification?] WB: If we were running only our own money, putting 75% of our net worth in a single position is not a problem if it is something we really have high confidence in. Putting 500% or more of your net worth in a position is a problem. Several times I have had 75% of my non-Berkshire net worth in a situation. You will see things where it would be a mistake not to act. You won\\\\u2019t see them often, and the press and your friends won\\\\u2019t be talking about them. Wouldn\\\\u2019t you say, Charlie? 75% is not a real significant amount? CM: Sometimes, I have had more than 100% in an individual investment. WB: You just had a good banker. Look at LTCM \\\\u2014 they put 25x their money in things that had to converge but couldn\\\\u2019t play out the hand. There are people in this room with more than 90% of their worth in Berkshire. I saw things in 2002 in junk bonds that would have been worth going heavily into. You could have bought Cap Cities in 1974 \\\\u2014 selling for one-third the property value, with the best manager, and in a good business. You could have put 100% in Coca-Cola when we bought it and that wouldn\\\\u2019t have been a dangerous position. CM: Students learn corporate finance at business schools. They are taught that the whole secret is diversification. But the exact rule is the opposite. The \\\\u2018know-nothing\\\\u2019 investor should practice diversification, but it is crazy if you are an expert. The goal of investment is to find situations where it is safe not to diversify. If you only put 20% into the opportunity of a life-time, you are not being rational.

The key to Graham\\'s approach to investing is not thinking of stocks as stocks or part of the stock market. Stocks are part of a business. People in this room own a piece of a business. If the business does well, they\\'re going to do all right as long as long as they don\\'t pay way too much to join in to that business. So we\\'re thinking about business risk. Business risk can arise in various ways. It can arise from the capital structure. When somebody sticks a ton of debt into a business, if there\\'s a hiccup in the business, then the lenders foreclose. It can come about by their naturethere are just certain businesses that are very risky. Back when there were more commercial aircraft manufacturers, Charlie and I would think of making a commercial\\\\u00a0 airplane as a sort of bet-your-company risk because you would shell out hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars before you really had customers, and then if you had a problem with the plane, the company could go. There are certain businesses that inherently, because of long lead time, because of heavy capital investment, basically have a lot of risk. Commodity businesses have a lot of risk unless you\\'re a low-cost producer, because the low-cost producer can put you out of business. Our textile business was not the low-cost producer. We had fine management, everybody worked hard, we had cooperative unions, all kinds of things. But we weren\\'t the low-cost producers so it was a risky business. The guy who could sell it cheaper than we could made it risky for us. We tend to go into businesses that are inherently low risk and are capitalized in a way that that low risk of the business is transformed into a low risk for the enterprise. The risk beyond that is that even though you identify such businesses, you pay too much for them. That risk is usually a risk of time rather than principal, unless you get into a really extravagant situation. Then the risk becomes the risk of you yourselfwhether you can retain your belief in the real fundamentals of the business and not get too concerned about the stock market. The stock market is there to serve you and not to instruct you. That\\'s a key to owning a good business and getting rid of the risk that would otherwise exist in the market. You mention volatilityit doesn\\'t make any difference to us whether the volatility of the stock market is a half a percentage of a point a day, or a quarter percent a day, or five percent a day. In fact, we\\'d probably make a lot more money if volatility was higher because it would create more mistakes in the market. Volatility is a huge plus to the real investor. Ben Graham used the example of Mr. Market. Ben said that just imagine that when you bought a stock you in effect bought into a business where you have this obliging partner who comes around every day and offers you a price at which he\\'ll either buy or sell and that price is identical. No one ever gets that in a private business, where daily you get a buy-sell offer by a party. But you get that in the stock market, and that\\'s a huge advantage. And it\\'s a bigger advantage if this partner of yours is a heavy-drinking manic depressive. (laughter) The crazier he is, the more money you\\'re going to make. So, as an investor, you love volatility. Not if you\\'re on margin, but if you\\'re an investor you\\'re not on margin, and if you\\'re an investor you love to get these wild swings because it means more things are going to get mispriced.  Actually, volatility in recent years has dampened from what it used to be. It looks bigger because people think in terms of Dow points, but volatility was much higher many years ago than it is now. The amplitude of the swings used to be really wild and that gave you more opportunity. Charlie? [CM:\\\\u00a0 Well it came to be that corporate finance departments at universities developed the notion of risk-adjusted returns. My best advice to all of you would be to totally ignore this development. Risk had a very good colloquial meaning, meaning a substantial chance that something could go horribly wrong, and the finance professors sort of got volatility mixed up with a bunch of foolish mathematics and to me it\\'s less rational than what we do. And I don\\'t think we\\'re going to change.] Finance departments believe that volatility equals risk. They want to measure risk, and they don\\'t know how to do it, basically. So they said volatility measures risk. I\\'ve often used the example of the Washington Post\\'s stock. When I first bought it in 1973 it had gone down almost 50%, from a valuation of the whole company of close to $170 million down to $80 million. Because it happened pretty fast, the beta of the stock had actually increased, and a professor would have told you that the company was more risky if you bought it for $80 million than if you bought it for $170 million. That\\'s something I\\'ve thought about ever since they told me that 25 years ago and I still haven\\'t figured it out. (laughter) - One key aspect to risk is how long you expect to hold an investment, i.e., stock in Coca Cola might be very risky if bought for a day trade or to hold for only a week. But, over a 5 or 10 year period it probably has almost no risk at all. The myth that volatility of a stock somehow equates to risk was discussed. In fact, volatility often creates great opportunity, in Buffett\\'s view. The following comments on risk in investments were in the 1993 Annual Report, on page 14: \\\\\"Charlie and I decided long ago that in an investment lifetime it\\'s just too hard to make hundreds of smart decisions. That judgment became ever more compelling as Berkshire\\'s capital mushroomed and the universe of investments that could significantly affect our results shrank dramatically. Therefore, we adopted a strategy that required our being smart- and not too smart at that - only a very few times. Indeed, we\\'ll now settle for one good idea a year. (Charlie says it\\'s my turn.) The strategy we\\'ve adopted precludes our following standard diversification dogma. Many pundits would therefore say the strategy must be riskier than that employed by more conventional investors. We disagree. We believe that a policy of portfolio concentration may well decrease risk if it raises, as it should, both the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business and the comfort level he must feel with its economic characteristics before buying into it. In stating this opinion, we define risk, using dictionary terms, as \\\\\"the possibility of loss or injury\\\\\". Academics, however, like to define investment \\\\\"risk\\\\\" differently, averring that it is the relative volatility of a stock or portfolio of stocks - that is, their volatility as compared to that of a large universe of stocks. Employing data bases and statistical skills, these academics compute with precision the \\\\\"beta\\\\\" of a stock - its relative volatility in the past - and then build arcane investment and capital-allocation theories around this calculation. In their hunger for a single statistic to measure risk, however, they forget a fundamental principle: It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong\\\\\". For owners of a business - and that\\'s the way we think of shareholders - the academics\\' definition of risk is far off the mark, so much so that it produces absurdities. For example, under beta-based theory, a stock that has dropped very sharply compared to the market - as had Washington Post when we bought it in 1973 - becomes \\\\\"riskier\\\\\" at the lower price than it was at the higher price. Would that description have then made any sense to someone who was offered the entire company at a vastly-reduced price? - \\\\\"We regard using [a stock\\'s] volatility as a measure of risk is nuts. Risk to us is 1) the risk of permanent loss of capital, or 2) the risk of inadequate return. Some great businesses have very volatile returns  for example, See\\'s usually loses money in two quarters of each year  and some terrible businesses can have steady results. [Munger: \\\\\"How can professors spread this? I\\'ve been waiting for this craziness to end for decades. It\\'s been dented, but it\\'s still out there.\\\\\"] If someone starts talking to you about beta, zip up your pocketbook.\\\\\" - We think the best way to minimize risk is to think.  Our default is [to have our capital] in short-term instruments and only do something when it makes sense. - [RE: Beta] Volatility does not measure risk. The problem is that the people who have written about and taught volatility do not understand risk. Beta is nice and mathematical, but it\\\\u2019s wrong. Past volatility does not determine risk. Take farmland here in Nebraska: the price of land went from $2,000 to $600 per acre. The beta of farms went way up, so according to standard economic theory, I was taking more risk buying at $600. Most people would know that\\\\u2019s nonsense because farms aren\\\\u2019t traded. But stocks are traded and jiggle around and so people who study markets translate past volatility into all kinds of measures of risk. The whole concept of volatility is useful for people whose career is teaching, but useless to us. Risk comes from the nature of certain kinds of businesses by the simple economics of the business, and from not knowing what you\\\\u2019re doing. If you understand the economics and you know the people, then you\\\\u2019re not taking much risk. Munger: We\\\\u2019d argue that what\\\\u2019s taught is at least 50% twaddle, but these people have high IQs. We recognized early on that very smart people do very dumb things, and we wanted to know why and who, so we could avoid them. [Laughter] Buffett: We are willing to lose $6 billion in one catastrophe, but our insurance business over time is not very risky. If you own a roulette wheel, you sometimes have to pay 35-to-1, but that\\\\u2019s okay. We would love to own a lot of roulette wheels.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"How much and how does risk factor into your investment decisions? Would you invest in emerging markets?\", \"answer\": \"In general, emerging markets are not great for me because I need to put a lot of money to work. Risk does not equal beta.

The first is can I understand the business and understand the downside not just today but five to ten years from now. There have been very few times that I\\\\u2019ve lost 1% of my net worth. I might be risk averse but I am not action adverse. Mrs. B saved $500 over the course of 16 years to start and build Nebraska Furniture Mart.

The beautiful thing about investing is that it\\\\u2019s a \\\\u201cNo called strike game\\\\u201d where unlike baseball the only strikes in investing are when you swing. I don\\\\u2019t have to swing. When I do invest, I don\\\\u2019t care if the stock price goes from $10 to $2 but I do care about if the value went from $10 to $2. Avoid debt. I decided early on that I never wanted to owe more than 25% of my net worth, and I haven\\\\u2019t\\\\u2026 except for in the very beginning. I like to play from a position of strength.

But every now and then, things really get out of whack. But the gradations in between are too tough.

But what he found was that stocks outperformed the bonds in nearly all cases. John M. Keynes then enumerated the reasons that this was so. He said that over time you have more capital working for you, and thus dividends would grow higher. This was novel information back then and investors then went crazy and started buying stocks for these higher returns. But then they started to get crazy, and no longer really applied the sound tactics that made the reasons given in the book true. Be careful that when you buy something for a sound reason, make sure that the reason stays sound. If you buy GM, you need to write the price and the respective market valuation. Then write down why you are buying the business. If you can\\'t, then you have no business doing it.

If there\\'s 2% inflation and 3% [real] growth, that\\'s 5%. This will be the rate of corporate growth, so if you add dividends, you get 6-7% [annualized returns] before frictional costs  and investors incur high frictional costs (they don\\'t have to, but they do)  which adds up to 1.5%. [This 4.5-5.5% is] not bad. [CM: My attitude is slightly more negative than Warren\\'s.] It [6-7% growth] is not the end of the world. If we get 5-6% of the pie  those of us who put our capital out  I don\\'t know if it\\'s exactly what someone who designed the universe would come up with, but I don\\'t think that\\'s crazy in either direction. It provides a pretty decent real return in a period of low inflation. If you get high inflation, you could get very low real returns, even negative.

The exchange of yesterday will be better for the American investor. I know the American investor will not be better off if volume doubles on the NYSE, and I know the NYSE will be trying to figure out how to do that if it is trying to maximize its own earnings per share. Trading is the frictional cost of capitalism. GM or IBM will not earn more money if their stock turns over more actively, but a for-profit NYSE will. [CM: I feel the same, only more strongly.

You really have American businesses earning close to something 20% on equity. And that is something nobody dreamed of and that is being produced by very large companies in aggregate.

For example, from private equity funds?\", \"answer\": \"You are absolutely correct that the private equity funds are a form of competition for Berkshire.  Stocks sometimes trade well below intrinsic value, but businesses are sold in a negotiated transaction, so pricing doesn\\\\u2019t get as extreme.  But our strong preference is to buy entire businesses at a fair price rather than stocks, even if stocks [can be acquired] a bit cheaper. If someone wants what we are offering, we are pretty much one-of-a-kind.  People can sell their company to us, yet continue to run it as they please as long as they want.  So, if someone needs liquidity for tax or inheritance or other reasons, but doesn\\\\u2019t want to auction their business off like a piece of meat, they can come to us and they know they\\\\u2019ll get the response they want.  We don\\\\u2019t get super bargains this way, but it allows us to put money to work at a sensible price. Acquisitions don\\\\u2019t come along every day. If I owned a business that my father had started and wanted to monetize it, I would sell to Berkshire because I wouldn\\\\u2019t want to split it up to auction it off, just as it would be silly to auction your daughter off to the man who bids the most. There is no-one else who can make the promises we can make [not to ever sell the acquired company].  Most big companies can\\\\u2019t do that because what if the board decides it wants a pure play?  I tell sellers that I\\\\u2019m the only one who can double cross you \\\\u2013 nobody else can.  We don\\\\u2019t have consultants or Wall Street advisors. But, yes, we do have a lot of competition. [CM: We\\\\u2019ve had private equity competitors for a long time, but one way or another we\\\\u2019ve managed to buy quite a few things.] - We are positioned very badly in terms of buying businesses. Berkshire will not do as well as long as this persists. [CM: A lot of buying is fee motivated. Managers want to earn the extra fees on the extra assets. I have a friend who buys warehouses, but he stopped bidding recently because he\\\\u2019s always being outbid. Howard Marks sent a lot of money back to investors, which is the right way to behave [I assume he\\\\u2019s referring to one of the Principals of Oaktree Capital Management]] Five or six years ago, I got a call from a well-known investor who asked me a lot of questions about reinsurance. He didn\\\\u2019t know much about the business, but he was considering buying a reinsurance company because, as he explained to me, he would have to send his investors\\\\u2019 money back to them if he didn\\\\u2019t invest it in the next few months, and he was earning 2% [annually] on it. We [unlike this gentleman] have all of our net worth on the downside as well. If we have 2 and 20 [2% management fee and a 20% performance allocation] on the upside and nothing but a goodbye kiss on the downside... The competition right now is tough, so our efforts to buy businesses are likely to be futile. But there are 1-2 deals we might get done... [CM: I don\\\\u2019t think there\\\\u2019s any business that we\\\\u2019ve bought that would have sold itself to a hedge fund. There\\\\u2019s a class of businesses that doesn\\\\u2019t want to deal with private-equity and hedge funds...thank God. (Laughter)] We don\\\\u2019t see any deals [recently] that we wish we\\\\u2019d made \\\\u2013 this wasn\\\\u2019t true in the past \\\\u2013 even if the price had been 10% lower. We\\\\u2019re in a different world right now. - There\\\\u2019s no doubt that there\\\\u2019s far more money looking a deals now than in the past. They\\\\u2019re willing to pay up to buy good but mundane businesses that we\\\\u2019ve historically bought and had success with. Now it\\\\u2019s not just private equity funds getting in \\\\u2013 hedge funds are too. There\\\\u2019s been a bit of a change in the past few weeks, as it\\\\u2019s gotten a little harder to borrow money, but overall, we can\\\\u2019t compete, which makes us feel distress. But it won\\\\u2019t go on forever. In the near term, we are not positioned favorably at all, but you\\\\u2019d be amazed at just how fast things can change. Things happen to change the landscape. At least three times in my career, there\\\\u2019s been so much money sloshing around. It was so bad in 1969 that I closed my partnership. But only four years later, it was the best time to be a buyer in my entire life. - [Re: Closed-End Funds] History shows that over time, almost all closed-end funds go to discounts. Initially, if they\\\\u2019re sold with a 6% commission, the initial people only get 94 cents on the dollar. If I could buy an open fund at X or a closed-end fund at 120% of X, then you\\\\u2019d have to convince me that the management is something special to buy the closed-end fund. Occasionally, Charlie and I have seen closed-end funds that trade at a premium for a long time. Eventually they will come back down to earth.  [Q - Is the private-equity boom a bubble?] We\\\\u2019re competing with those people, so I started to cry, thinking about the difficulty of finding things to buy. Due to the nature of private equity, it\\\\u2019s not a bubble that will burst. They lock up their money for 5-10 years and buy businesses that don\\\\u2019t price daily. It takes many years for the score to be put on the board and the investors can\\\\u2019t leave. It\\\\u2019s not like leverage in marketable securities. What would slow it down is if the spread between high-yield bonds and safe bonds widens. This would slow down deals, but won\\\\u2019t cause investors to get their money back. There\\\\u2019s another factor: if you have a $20 billion fund and get a 2% fee, you\\\\u2019re getting $400M a year. But you can\\\\u2019t raise another fund with a straight face until you\\\\u2019ve invested it, so there\\\\u2019s a great compulsion to invest it quickly so you can raise another fund and get more fees. We can\\\\u2019t compete against these buyers. We buy forever and it\\\\u2019s our own money. I think it will be quite some time before disillusion sets in [among the investors in private-equity funds].

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Investing is about laying out a bird now to get two or more out of the bush. The keys are to only look at the bushes you like and identify how long it will take to get them out. When interest rates are 20%, you need to get it out right now. When rates are 1%, you have 10 years. Think about what the asset will produce. Look at the asset, not the beta. I don\\\\u2019t really care about volatility. Stock price is not that important to me, it just gives you the opportunity to buy at a great price. I don\\\\u2019t care if they close the NYSE for 5 years. I care more about the business than I do about events. I care about if there\\\\u2019s price flexibility and whether the company can gain more market share. I care about people drinking more Coke. I bought a farm from the FDIC 20 years ago for $600 per acre. Now I don\\\\u2019t know anything about farming but my son does. I asked him, how much it cost to buy corn, plow the field, harvest, how much an acre will yield, what price to expect. I haven\\\\u2019t gotten a quote on that farm in 20 years. If I were running a business school I would only have 2 courses. The first would obviously be an investing class about how to value a business. The second would be how to think about the stock market and how to deal with the volatility. The stock market is funny. You have no compulsion to act and a bunch of silly people setting prices all the time, it is great odds. I want the market to be like a manic depressive drunk. Graham\\\\u2019s Ch. 8, in the book Intelligent Investor, on Mr. Market is the most important thing I have ever read. Now think about the NYSE. You have thousands of companies to choose from.

We try to work with businesses where we have fairly high probability of knowing what the future will hold. If you own a gas pipeline, not much is going to go wrong. Maybe a competitor enters forcing you to cut prices, but intrinsic value hasn\\'t gone down if you already factored this in. We looked at a pipeline recently that we think will come under pressure from other ways of delivering gas [to the area the pipeline serves]. We look at this differently from another pipeline that has the lowest costs [and does not face threats from alternative pipelines]. If you calculate intrinsic value properly, you factor in things like declining prices. When we buy business, we try to look out and estimate the cash it will generate and compare it to the purchase price. We have to feel pretty good about our projections and then have a purchase price that makes sense. Over time, we\\'ve had more pleasant surprises than we would have expected. I\\'ve never seen an investment banker\\'s book in which future earnings are projected to go down. But many businesses\\' earnings go down.

It would be like looking at a bond that had a bunch of coupons on it that was due in a hundred years ... Businesses have coupons too, the only problem is that they\\'re not printed on the instrument and it\\'s up to the investor to try to estimate what those coupons are going to be over time. In high-tech businesses, or something like that, we don\\'t have the faintest idea what the coupons are going to be. In the businesses where we think we can understand them reasonably well, we are trying to print the coupons out. If you attempt to assess intrinsic value, it all relates to cash flow. The only reason to put cash into any kind of investment now is that you expect to take cash outnot by selling it to somebody else, that\\'s just a game of who beats whobut by the asset itself ... If you\\'re an investor, you\\'re looking on what the asset is going to do, if you\\'re a speculator, you\\'re commonly focusing on what the price of the object is going to do, and that\\'s not our game. We feel that if we\\'re right about the business, we\\'re going to make a lot of money, and if we\\'re wrong about the business, we don\\'t have any hopes of making money. [CM:\\\\u00a0 I would argue that one filter that\\'s useful in investing is the idea of opportunity costs. If you have one idea that\\'s available in large quantity that\\'s better that 98% of the other opportunities, then you can just screen out the other 98% ... With this attitude you get a concentrated portfolio, which we don\\'t mind. That practice of ours which is so simple is not widely copied, I don\\'t know why. Even at great universities and intellectual institutions. It\\'s an interesting question: If we\\'re right, why are so many other places so wrong.] There are several possible answers to that question! (laughter) The first question we ask ourselves is, would we rather own this business than more Coca-Cola, than more Gillette .... We will want companies where the certainty gets close to that, or we would figure we\\'d be better off buying more Coke.

They are absolutely wonderful businesses run by sensational people, and they are selling at prices that are higher than they\\'ve sold at most of the time. But they may well be worth it, either in present terms, or they may be a couple of years ahead of themselves. Gillette doesn\\'t repurchase their shares ... Coke consistently repurchases their shares. We generally like the policy of companies that have really wonderful businesses repurchasing their shares. The problem with most companies repurchasing their shares is that they are frequently so-so businesses and they are repurchasing shares for purposes other than intensifying the interest of shareholders in a wonderful business. It\\'s hard to do things intelligently with money in this world and Coke has been very intelligent about using their capital, particularly to fortify and develop their bottler network around the world, but there\\'s only so far you can go with that, and to enhance the ownership of shareholders in a company like Coca-Cola [is great]. The bottling is actually kind of interesting ... Asa Canver back in the late 1880\\'s essentially bought the whole Coca-Cola company for $2,000, and that may be the smartest purchase in the history of the world. Then in 1889, a couple of guys from Chattanooga came along, and in those days soft drinks were sold over the counter, and they said bottling\\'s got a future and you\\'re busy with the pump side of the business, so why don\\'t you let us develop the bottling side of the business. And I guess Mr. Canver didn\\'t think much of bottling, so he gave them a contract that gave them the rights, in perpetuity for almost all of the United States, and gave them the right to buy Coca-Cola syrup at a fixed price forever. (audience groans) So Asa, who had scored with his $2,000 in a major way, seems to have made one of the dumbest contracts in history. And the Coca-Cola company was faced over the years with the problem of having this bottling system which soon became the dominant system of distribution for Coke, being subject to a contract where there was no price flexibility and where the contract ran for perpetuity. And of course every bottler on his deathbed would call his children and grandchildren around, and he would prop himself up, and he would croak out in his last breath, \\\\\"Don\\'t let \\'em screw with the bottling contract.\\\\\" (laughter) So the Coca-Cola company faced this for decades, and they couldn\\'t really do anything about the bottling system for a long time, and Roberto and Don Keough and some other people spent 20, 25 years getting that rationalized ...it was a huge, huge project, but it made an enormous difference over time, and that\\'s what I mean when I talk about intellectual capital. You know you\\'re not going to get results on that in a day or a month or a year, but they decided that to get the job done they had to do this, and they used capital to get that job done, but they used capital beyond that to repurchase shares, and it\\'s been very smart, and they\\'re probably repurchasing shares even as we talk. [CM: I do think the Coca-Cola company is one of the most interesting cases in the history of business, and it ought to be way more studied than it is. There\\'s just lesson after lesson after lesson in the history of the Coca-Cola company.

This is theSt. Petersburg Paradox, written about by Durand 30 years ago.  [Clickherefor a copy of the original 1957 article.  For more on this topic, I recommendIntegrating the Outliers: Two Lessons from the St. Petersburg Paradox, by CSFB\\\\u2019s (now Legg Mason\\\\u2019s) Michael Mauboussin.] Some managements think this [that the value of their company is infinite].

The idea of projecting extremely high growth rates for a long period of time has cost investors an awful lot of money.

It is like finding a home for a painting. Business owners who are looking to sell can either sell their businesses to Berkshire (like putting painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art) or sell to an LBO and let them tear it up, dress up the accounting, and resell it (like selling a painting to a porn shop).   It\\'s a question of being able to identify businesses that you understand and you are very certain about. If you understand those businesses, and many people do, but Charlie and I don\\'t, then you have the opportunity to evaluate them. If you decide they\\'re fairly priced and they have marvellous prospects, you\\'re going to do very well. But there\\'s a whole group of companiesa very large group of companiesthat Charlie and I just don\\'t know how to value. And that doesn\\'t bother us. I mean, we don\\'t know how to figure out what cocoa beans are going to do, or the Russian rublethere\\'s all kinds of financial instruments that we just don\\'t feel we have the knowledge to evaluate. It might be a bit too much to expect somebody would understand every business in the world. We find some that are much harder for us to understand. When I say understandmy definition of understand is that you have to have a pretty good idea of where it\\'s going to be in ten years. I just can\\'t get that conviction with a lot of businesses, whereas I can get them with relatively few. But I only need a fewsix or eight, as you pointed out, or something like that. It would be better for youit certainly would have been better for you if we had had the insights about what we regard as the more complicated businesses you describebecause there was and may still be a chance to make a whole lot more money if those growth rates that you describe are maintained. I don\\'t think you\\'ll find better managers than Andy Grove at Intel or Bill Gates at Microsoft and they certainly seem to have fantastic positions in the businesses they\\'re in, but I don\\'t know enough about those businesses to be sure that those businesses are fantastic as I am about being sure that Gillette and Coca-Cola\\'s businesses are fantastic. You may understand those businesses better than you understand Coke and Gillette because of your background or just the way your mind is wired. But I don\\'t, and therefore I have to stick with what I really think I can understand. - We favor businesses where we really think we know the answer. If we think the business\\\\u2019s competitive position is shaky, we won\\\\u2019t try to compensate with price. We want to buy a great business, defined as having a high return on capital for a long period of time, where we think management will treat us right. We like to buy at 40 cents on the dollar, but will pay a lot closer to $1 on the dollar for a great business. If we see someone who weighs 300 pounds or 320 pounds, it doesn\\\\u2019t matter \\\\u2013 we know they\\\\u2019re fat. We look for fat businesses. We don\\\\u2019t get paid for the past, only the future [profitability of a business]. The past is only useful to give you insights into the future, but sometimes there\\\\u2019s no insight. At times, we\\\\u2019ve been able to buy businesses at one quarter of what they\\\\u2019re worth, but we haven\\\\u2019t seen that recently [pause] except South Korea. Munger: Margin of safety means getting more value than you\\\\u2019re paying. There are many ways to get value. It\\\\u2019s high school algebra; if you can\\\\u2019t do this, then don\\\\u2019t invest. Munger: When you\\\\u2019re trying to determine intrinsic value and margin of safety, there\\\\u2019s no one easy method that can simply be mechanically applied by a computer that will make someone who pushes the buttons rich. You have to apply a lot of models. I don\\\\u2019t think you can become a great investor rapidly, no more than you can become a bone-tumor pathologist quickly. Buffett: Let\\\\u2019s say you decide you want to buy a farm and you make calculations that you can make $70/acre as the owner. How much will you pay [per acre for that farm]? Do you assume agriculture will get better so you can increase yields? Do you assume prices will go up? You might decide you wanted a 7% return, so you\\\\u2019d pay $1,000/acre. If it\\\\u2019s for sale at $800, you buy, but if it\\\\u2019s at $1,200, you don\\\\u2019t. Buffett: If you\\\\u2019re going to buy a farm, you\\\\u2019d say, \\\\u201cI bought it to earn $X growing soybeans.\\\\u201d It wouldn\\\\u2019t be based on what you saw on TV or what a friend said. It\\\\u2019s the same with stocks. Take out a yellow pad and say, \\\\u201cIf I\\\\u2019m going to buy GM at $30, it has 600 million shares, so I\\\\u2019m paying $18 billion,\\\\u201d and answer the question, why? If you can\\\\u2019t answer that, you\\\\u2019re not subjecting it to business tests. We have to understand the competitive position and dynamics of the business and look out into the future. With some businesses, you can\\\\u2019t. The math of investing was set out by Aesop in 600 BC: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. We ask ourselves how certain we are about birds in the bush. Are there really two? Might there be more? We simply choose which bushes we want to buy from in the future. The ability to generate cash and reinvest it is critical. It\\\\u2019s the ability to generate cash that gives Berkshire value. We choose to retain it because [we think we can reinvest each dollar to generate more than $1 of value]. If you were thinking about paying $900,000 or $1.3 million for a McDonald\\\\u2019s stand, you\\\\u2019d think about things like whether people will keep eating hamburgers and whether McDonald\\\\u2019s could change the franchise agreement. You have to know what you\\\\u2019re doing and whether you\\\\u2019re within your circle of competence. Munger: We have no system for estimating the correct value of all businesses.

Imagine a $100 million business that earns 20% in one year, reinvests the $20 million profit and in the next year earns 20% of $120 million and so forth. But there are very very few businesses like this. Coke has high returns on capital, but incremental capital doesn\\'t earn anything like its current returns. We love businesses that can earn high rates on even more capital than it earns. Most of our businesses generate lots of money, but can\\'t generate high returns on incremental capital  for example, See\\'s and Buffalo News. We look for them [areas to wisely reinvest capital], but they don\\'t exist. So, what we do is take money and move it around into other businesses. The newspaper business earned great returns but not on incremental capital. But the people in the industry only knew how to reinvest it [so they squandered a lot of capital]. But our structure allows us to take excess capital and invest it elsewhere, wherever it makes the most sense. It\\'s an enormous advantage. See\\'s has produced $1 billion pre-tax for us over time. If we\\'d deployed that in the candy business, the returns would have been terrible, but instead we took the money out of the business and redeployed it elsewhere. Look at the results! [CM: There are two kinds of businesses: The first earns 12%, and you can take it out at the end of the year. The second earns 12%, but all the excess cash must be reinvested  there\\'s never any cash. It reminds me of the guy who looks at all of his equipment and says, \\\\\"There\\'s all of my profit.\\\\\" We hate that kind of business.] We like to be able to move cash around and find it\\'s best use. We\\'d love to have our companies redeploy cash, but they can\\'t. Gillette has a great business, but can\\'t sensibly reinvest all of the profit. We don\\'t think the batting average of American industry redeploying capital has been very great. We knock other people doing what has made us so successful. [CM: I\\'m uncomfortable with that, which is why we say negative things [to discourage others from trying to do what we do]].\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"What makes a great business?\", \"answer\": \"The best businesses can maintain their earnings without continued reinvestment, whereas in the worst you have to keep pouring money into a money-losing business.

The surgeon will retain his earnings power, regardless of inflation. [Untapped pricing power. The measure of a great business.] We like buying businesses with some untapped pricing power. For example, when we bought See\\\\u2019s for $25 million, I asked myself, \\\\u201cIf we raised prices by 10 cents per pound, would sales fall off a cliff?\\\\u201d The answer was obviously no. You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices. A good example is newspapers. The local daily paper controlled the market and every year they raised the [advertising] rates and circulation prices \\\\u2013 it was almost a big yawn. They didn\\\\u2019t worry about losing big advertisers like Sears, JC Penney or Wal-Mart, or losing subscribers. They increased prices whether the price of newsprint went up or down.

Let\\\\u2019s start with that. That narrows it down by 90%. There are all types of things I don\\\\u2019t understand, but fortunately, there is enough I do understand. You have this big wide world out there and almost every company is publicly owned. So you have all American business practically available to you. So it makes sense to go with things you can understand. I can understand this, anyone can understand this (Buffett holds up a bottle of Coca-Cola). Since 1886, it is a simple business, but it is not an easy business\\\\u2014I don\\\\u2019t want an easy business for competitors. I want a business with a moat around it. I want a very valuable castle in the middle and then I want the Duke who is in charge of that castle to be very honest and hard working and able. Then I want a moat around that castle. The moat can be various things: The moat around our auto insurance business, Geico, is low cost. People have to buy auto insurance so everyone is going to have one auto insurance policy per car basically. I can\\\\u2019t sell them 20, but they have to buy one. I can sell them 1. What are they going to buy it on? (based on what criteria?) They (customers) will buy based on service and cost. Most people will assume the service is identical among companies or close enough. So they will do it on cost. So I have to be a low cost producerthat is my moat. To the extent that my costs are further below the other guy, I have thrown a couple of sharks into the moat. All the time you have this wonderful castle, there are people out there who are going to attack it and try to take it away from you. I want a castle I can understand, but I want a castle with a moat around it. 30 years ago, Eastman Kodak\\\\u2019s moat was just as wide as Coca-Cola\\\\u2019s moat. I mean if you were going to take a picture of your six-month old baby and you want to look at that picture 20 years from now or 50 years from now. And you are never going to get a chance\\\\u2014you are not a professional photographer\\\\u2014so you can evaluate what is going to look good 20 or 50 years ago. What is in your mind about that photography company (Share of Mind) is what counts. Because they are promising you that the picture you take today is going to be terrific 20 to 50 years from now about something that is very important to you. Well, Kodak had that in spades 30 years ago, they owned that. They had what I call share of mind. Forget about share of market, share of mind. They had something\\\\u2014that little yellow box\\\\u2014that said Kodak is the best. That is priceless. They have lost some of that. They haven\\\\u2019t lost it all. It is not due to George Fisher. George is doing a great job, but they let that moat narrow. They let Fuji come and start narrowing the moat in various ways. They let them get into the Olympics and take away that special aspect that only Kodak was fit to photograph the Olympics. So Fuji gets there and immediately in people\\\\u2019s minds, Fuji becomes more into parity with Kodak. You haven\\\\u2019t seen that with Coke; Coke\\\\u2019s moat is wider now than it was 30 years ago. You can\\\\u2019t see the moat day by day but every time the infrastructure that gets built in some country that isn\\\\u2019t yet profitable for Coke that will be 20 years from now. The moat is widening a little bit. Things are, all the time, changing a little in one direction or the other. Ten years from now, you will see the difference. Our managers of the businesses we run, I have one message to them, and we want to widen the moat. We want to throw crocs, sharks and gators\\\\u2014I guess\\\\u2014into the moat to keep away competitors. That comes about through service, through quality of product, it comes about through cost, some times through patents, and/or real estate location. So that is the business I am looking for. Now what kind of businesses am I going to find like that? Well, I am going to find them in simple products because I am not going to be able to figure what the moat is going to look like for Oracle, Lotus or Microsoft, ten years from now. Gates is the best businessman I have ever run into and they have a hell of a position, but I really don\\\\u2019t know what that business is going to look like ten years from now. I certainly don\\\\u2019t know what his competitors will look like ten years from now. I know what the chewing business will look like ten years from now. The Internet is not going to change how we chew gum and nothing much else is going to change how we chew gum. There will lots of new products. Is Spearmint or Juicy Fruit going to evaporate? It isn\\\\u2019t going to happen. You give me a billion dollars and tell me to go into the chewing gum business and try to make a real dent in Wrigley\\\\u2019s. I can\\\\u2019t do it. That is how I think about businesses. I say to myself, give me a billion dollars and how much can I hurt the guy? Give me $10 billion dollars and how much can I hurt Coca-Cola around the world? I can\\\\u2019t do it. Those are good businesses. Now give me some money and tell me to hurt somebody in some other fields, and I can figure out how to do it. So I want a simple business, easy to understand, great economics now, honest and able management, and then I can see about in a general way where they will be ten (10) years from now. If I can\\\\u2019t see where they will be ten years from now, I don\\\\u2019t want to buy it. Basically, I don\\\\u2019t want to buy any stock where if they close the NYSE tomorrow for five years, I won\\\\u2019t be happy owning it. I buy a farm and I don\\\\u2019t get a quote on it for five years and I am happy if the farm does OK. I buy an apartment house and don\\\\u2019t get a quote on it for five years, I am happy if the apartment house produces the returns that I expect. People buy a stock and they look at the price next morning and they decide to see if they are doing well or not doing well. It is crazy. They are buying a piece of the business. That is what Graham\\\\u2014the most fundamental part of what he taught me. You are not buying a stock, you are buying part ownership in a business. You will do well if the business does well, if you didn\\\\u2019t pay a totally silly price. That is what it is all about. You ought to buy businesses you understand. Just like if you buy farms, you ought to buy farms you understand.It is not complicated. Incidentally, by the way, in calling this Graham-Buffett, this is pure Graham. I was very fortunate. I picked up his book (The Intelligent Investor) when I was nineteen; I got interested in stocks when I was 6 or 7.I bought my first stock when I was eleven. But I was playing around with all this stuff\\\\u2014I had charts and volume and I was making all types of technical calculations and everything. Then I picked up a little book that said you are not just buying some little ticker symbol, that bounces around every day, you are buying part of a business. Soon as I started thinking about it that way, everything else followed. It is very simple. So we buy businesses we think we can understand. There is no one here who can\\\\u2019t understand Coke. If I was teaching a class at business school, on the final exam I would pass out the information on an Internet company and ask each student to value it. Anybody that gave me an answer, I\\\\u2019d flunk (Laughter). I don\\\\u2019t know how to do it. But people do it all the time; it is more exciting. If you look at it like you are going to the racesthat is a different thingbut if you are investing.... Investing is putting out money to be sure of getting more back later at an appropriate rate. And to do that you have to understand what you are doing at any time. You have to understand the business.

The interesting thing about investments for me and my partner, Charlie Munger, the biggest mistakes have not been mistakes of commission, but of omission. They are where we knew enough about the business to do something and where, for one reason or another, sat they\\'re sucking out thumbs instead of doing something. And so we have passed up things where we could have made billions and billions of dollars from things we understood, forget about things we don\\\\u2019t understand. The fact I could have made billions of dollars from Microsoft doesn\\\\u2019t mean anything because I never could understand Microsoft. But if I can make billions out of healthcare stocks, then I should make it. And I didn\\\\u2019t when the Clinton health care program was proposed and they all went in the tank. We should have made a ton of money out of that because I could understand it. And didn\\\\u2019t make it. I should have made a ton of money out of Fannie Mae back the mid-1980s, but I didn\\\\u2019t do it. Those are billion dollar mistakes or multi-billion dollar mistakes that generally accepted accounting principles don\\\\u2019t pick up. The mistakes you see. I made a mistake when I bought US Air Preferred some years ago. I had a lot of money around. I make mistakes when I get cash. Charlie tells me to go to a bar instead. Don\\\\u2019t hang around the office. But I hang around the office and I have money in my pocket, I do something dumb. It happens every time. So I bought this thing. Nobody made me buy it. I now have an 800 number I call every time I think about buying a stock in an airline. I say, \\\\u201cI am Warren and I am an air-aholic.\\\\u201d They try to talk me down, \\\\u201cKeep talking don\\\\u2019t do anything rash.\\\\u201d Finally I got over it. But I bought it. And it looked like we would lose all our money in it. And we came very close to losing all our money in it.You can say we deserved to lose our money it. We bought it because it was an attractive security. But it was not in an attractive industry. I did the same thing in Salomon. I bought an attractive security in a business I wouldn\\\\u2019t have bought the equity in. So you could say that is one form of mistake. Buying something because you like the terms, but you don\\\\u2019t like the business that well. I have done that in the past and will probably do that again. The bigger mistakes are the ones of omission. Back when I had $10,000 I put $2,000 of it into a Sinclair Service Station which I lost, so the opportunity cost on that money is about $6 billion right nowfairly big mistakes. It makes me feel good when my Berkshire goes down, because the cost of my Sinclair Station goes down too. My 20% opportunity cost. I will say this, it is better to learn from other people\\\\u2019s mistakes as much as possible. But we don\\\\u2019t spend any time looking back at Berkshire. I have a partner, Charlie Munger; we have been pals for forty years\\\\u2014never had an argument. We disagree on things a lot but we don\\\\u2019t have arguments about it. We never look back. We just figure there is so much to look forward to that there is no sense thinking of what we might have done. It just doesn\\\\u2019t make any difference. You can only live life forward. You can learn something perhaps from the mistakes, but the big thing to do is to stick with the businesses you understand. So if there is a generic mistake outside your circle of competence like buying something that somebody tips you on or something of the sort. In an area you know nothing about, you should learn something from that which is to stay with what you can figure out yourself. You really want your decision making to be by looking in the mirror. Saying to yourself, \\\\u201cI am buying 100 shares of General Motors at $55 because........\\\\u201d It is your responsibility if you are buying it. There\\\\u2019s gotta be a reason and if you can\\\\u2019t state the reason, you shouldn\\\\u2019t buy it. If it is because someone told you about it at a cocktail party, not good enough.It can\\\\u2019t be because of the volume or a reason like the chart looks good. It has to be a reason to buy the business. That we stick to pretty carefully. That is one of the things Ben Graham taught me. - If we start buying a stock, we want to go in heavy. I can\\'t think of a stock where we wanted to quit. We\\'ve made some big mistakes starting to buy something that was cheap and within our circle of competence, but trickled off because price went up a bit. Good ideas are too scarce to be parsimonious with. [CM: After nearly making a terrible mistake not buying See\\'s, we\\'ve made this mistake many times. We are apparently slow learners. These opportunity costs don\\'t show up on financial statements, but have cost us many billions.]  The main mistakes we\\\\u2019ve made \\\\u2013 some of them big time \\\\u2013 are: 1) Ones when we didn\\\\u2019t invest at all, even when we understood it was cheap; and 2) Starting in on an investment and not maximizing it. Charlie is a big fan of doing things on a big scale.  But when I bought something at X and it went up to X and 1/8th, I sometimes stopped buying, perhaps hoping it would come back down.  We\\\\u2019ve missed billions when I\\\\u2019ve gotten anchored. [CM: Do you have anything worse to confess than Wal-Mart? I cost us about $10 billion.  I set out to buy 100 million sharers, pre-split, at $23.  We bought a little and it moved up a bit and I stopped buying.  Perhaps I thought it might come back a bit \\\\u2013 who knows?  That thumb-sucking, the reluctance to pay a little more, cost us a lot.  There are other examples. On the other hand, it doesn\\\\u2019t bother us.  If every shot you hit in golf was a hole-in-one, you\\\\u2019d lose interest.  You gotta hit a few in the woods. We probably won\\\\u2019t make the kind of mistake that costs us a lot \\\\u2013 though we did with Dexter Shoes.  We\\\\u2019re more likely to make mistakes of omission, not commission, in the future. [CM: Since mistakes of omission don\\\\u2019t appear in the financial statements, most people don\\\\u2019t pay attention to them.  We rub our noses in mistakes of omission \\\\u2013 as we just did.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"How do you determine what is the proper price to pay for the business?\", \"answer\": \"It is a tough thing to decide but I don\\\\u2019t want to buy into any business I am not terribly sure of. So if I am terribly sure of it, it probably won\\\\u2019t offer incredible returns. Why should something that is essentially a cinch to do well, offer you 40% a year? We don\\\\u2019t have huge returns in mind, but we do have in mind not losing anything. We bought See\\\\u2019s Candy in 1972, See\\\\u2019s Candy was then selling 16 m. pounds of candy at a $1.95 a pound and it was making 2 bits a pound or $4 million pre-tax. We paid $25 million for it\\\\u20146.25 x pretax or about 10x after tax. It took no capital to speak of. When we looked at that business\\\\u2014basically, my partner, Charlie, and I\\\\u2014we needed to decide if there was some untapped pricing power there. Where that $1.95 box of candy could sell for $2 to $2.25. If it could sell for $2.25 or another $0.30 per pound that was $4.8 on 16 million pounds. Which on a $25 million purchase price was fine. We never hired a consultant in our lives; our idea of consulting was to go out and buy a box of candy and eat it. What we did know was that they had share of mind in California. There was something special. Every person in Ca. has something in mind about See\\\\u2019s Candy and overwhelmingly it was favorable. They had taken a box on Valentine\\\\u2019s Day to some girl and she had kissed him. If she slapped him, we would have no business. As long as she kisses him, that is what we want in their minds. See\\\\u2019s Candy means getting kissed. If we can get that in the minds of people, we can raise prices. I bought it in 1972, and every year I have raised prices on Dec. 26th, the day after Christmas, because we sell a lot on Christmas. In fact, we will make $60 million this year. We will make $2 per pound on 30 million pounds. Same business, same formulas, same everything$60 million bucks and it still doesn\\\\u2019t take any capital. And we make more money 10 years from now. But of that $60 million, we make $55 million in the three weeks before Christmas. And our company song is: \\\\u201cWhat a friend we have in Jesus.\\\\u201d (Laughter). It is a good business. Think about it a little. Most people do not buy boxed chocolate to consume themselves, they buy them as gifts\\\\u2014 somebody\\\\u2019s birthday or more likely it is a holiday. Valentine\\\\u2019s Day is the single biggest day of the year. Christmas is the biggest season by far. Women buy for Christmas and they plan ahead and buy over a two or three week period. Men buy on Valentine\\\\u2019s Day. They are driving home; we run ads on the Radio. Guilt, guilt, guilt\\\\u2014guys are veering off the highway right and left. They won\\\\u2019t dare go home without a box of Chocolates by the time we get through with them on our radio ads. So that Valentine\\\\u2019s Day is the biggest day. Can you imagine going home on Valentine\\\\u2019s Day\\\\u2014our See\\\\u2019s Candy is now $11 a pound thanks to my brilliance. And let\\\\u2019s say there is candy available at $6 a pound. Do you really want to walk in on Valentine\\\\u2019s Day and hand\\\\u2014she has all these positive images of See\\\\u2019s Candy over the years\\\\u2014and say, \\\\u201cHoney, this year I took the low bid.\\\\u201d And hand her a box of candy. It just isn\\\\u2019t going to work. So in a sense, there is untapped pricing power\\\\u2014it is not price dependent. Think of Disney. Disney is selling Home Videos for $16.95 or $18.95 or whatever. All over the world\\\\u2014people, and we will speak particularly about Mothers in this case, have something in their mind about Disney. Everyone in this room, when you say Disney, has something in their mind about Disney. When I say Universal Pictures, if I say 20th Century Fox, you don\\\\u2019t have anything special in your mind. Now if I say Disney, you have something special in your mind. That is true around the world. Now picture yourself with a couple of young kids, whom you want to put away for a couple of hours every day and get some peace of mind. You know if you get one video, they will watch it twenty times. So you go to the video store or wherever to buy the video. Are you going to sit there and premier 10 different videos and watch them each for an hour and a half to decide which one your kid should watch? No. Let\\\\u2019s say there is one there for $16.95 and the Disney one for $17.95\\\\u2014you know if you take the Disney video that you are going to be OK. So you buy it. You don\\\\u2019t have to make a quality decision on something you don\\\\u2019t want to spend the time to do. So you can get a little bit more money if you are Disney and you will sell a lot more videos. It makes it a wonderful business. It makes it very tough for the other guy. How would you try to create a brand\\\\u2014Dreamworks is trying\\\\u2014that competes with Disney around the world and replaces the concept that people have in their minds about Disney with something that says, Universal Pictures? So a mother is going to walk in and pick out a Universal Pictures video in preference to a Disney. It is not going to happen. Coca-Cola is associated with people being happy around the world. Everyplace \\\\u2013 Disneyland, the World Cup, the Olympics\\\\u2014where people are happy. Happiness and Coke go together. Now you give me\\\\u2014I don\\\\u2019t care how much money\\\\u2014and tell me that I am going to do that with RC Cola around the world and have five billion people have a favorable image in their mind about RC Cola. You can\\\\u2019t get it done. You can fool around, you can do what you want to do. You can have price discounts on weekends. But you are not going to touch it. That is what you want to have in a business. That is the moat. You want that moat to widen. If you are See\\\\u2019s Candy, you want to do everything in the world to make sure that the experience basically of giving that gift leads to a favorable reaction. It means what is in the box, it means the person who sells it to you, because all of our business is done when we are terribly busy. People come in during theose weeks before Chirstmas, Valentine\\\\u2019s Day and there are long lines. So at five o\\\\u2019clock in the afternoon some woman is selling someone the last box candy and that person has been waiting in line for maybe 20 or 30 customers. And if the salesperson smiles at that last customer, our moat has widened and if she snarls at \\\\u2018em, our moat has narrowed. We can\\\\u2019t see it, but it is going on everyday. But it is the key to it. It is the total part of the product delivery. It is having everything associated with it say, See\\\\u2019s Candy and something pleasant happening. That is what business is all about.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"What do you do if business changes are recognized?\", \"answer\": \"If a good business is doing dumb things with your money, it is wise to get out.

Sometimes businesses have problems, but haven\\'t lost their competitive advantages. When GEICO had problems [in the mid-1970s], the model wasn\\'t broken.

The name Coca-Cola means something to them. You know, RC Cola doesn\\'t mean something to virtually anyone in the world. Well, it does to the guy who owns RC, but everybody has something in their mind about Coca-Cola, and overwhelmingly it\\'s favorable. It\\'s associated with pleasant experiences. Now part of that is that by this time, [Coca-Cola is found] where you are happy, it is at Disneyworld, it\\'s at ballparks, every place you\\'re likely to have a smile on your face, including the Berkshire Hathaway meeting I might add. (laughter) And that position in the mind is pretty firmly established, and it\\'s established in close to 200 countries around the world. A year from now, it will be established in more minds and will have a slightly different overall position. In 10 years, the position will change just a little bit more. It\\'s share of mind, not share of market that counts. Disney, same wayDisney means something to billions of people. If you\\'re a parent with a couple of young children, and you\\'ve got 50 videos that you can buy, you\\'re not going to sit down and preview an hour and a half of each video before deciding which one to stick in front of your kids. And you\\'ve got something in mind about Disney that you don\\'t have about ABC Video Company, or you don\\'t even have about 20th Century, and you don\\'t have about Paramount. That name to billions of people has a meaning, and that meaning is overwhelmingly favorable, reinforced by the other activities of the company. Just think what someone would pay to buy that share of mind. You can\\'t do it. You can\\'t do it by a billion dollar advertising budget, or a 3 billion dollar advertising budget, or by hiring a twenty thousand supersalesmen. So you\\'ve got that. Now the question is what does that stand for 5 or 10 or 20 years from now. You know there\\'ll be more people, you know there\\'ll be more people familiar with Disney, and you know that there will always be parents who are interested in having something for their kids to do and that kids will love the same sort of things.\\\\u00a0 That\\'s what you\\'re trying to think about with a consumer products company. That\\'s what Charlie and I were thinking about when we bought See\\'s Candy. Who\\'s face lights up on Valentine\\'s Day when you hand them a box of candy from some nondescript company and you say, \\\\\"Here, honey, I took the low bid?\\\\\" You have many millions of people who got handed a box of [See\\'s] candy and it wasn\\'t that much thereafter that they got kissed for the first time. So the memories are good, the associations are good. A position in the mind is what counts in a consumer product. But it\\'s a total process ... a very good product may need tons of infrastructure. I had a case of Cherry Coke waiting for me at the Great Wall of China. You\\'ve got to have the product there when people want it. In World War II, General Eisenhower said to Mr. Woodruff that he wanted a Coca-Cola within arm\\'s length of every American servicemen in the world, and they built a lot of bottling plants to take care of that. That sort of positioning can be incredible. It seems to work especially well for American products. People want certain American products worldwide ... our music, our movies, our soft drinks, our fast food. I can\\'t imagine a French firm, or a German firm, or a Japanese firm selling 48% of the world\\'s soft drinks. It\\'s part of American culture and the world hungers for it. Kodak, for example, somehow does not have the same place in the world\\'s mind now that it did 20 years ago ... Fuji pushed their way to more parity with Kodak. You don\\'t want to ever let them do that. That\\'s why you can see a Coca-Cola or a Disney doing things that you think, well this doesn\\'t make a whole lot of sense, that if they didn\\'t spend this $10 million, wouldn\\'t they still sell just as much Coca-Cola. You don\\'t know which dollar is doing it, but you do know that virtually everybody in the world has heard of your product and has a favorable impression of it .... With See\\'s Candy, we\\'re no better than the last customer who\\'s been served their candy, but as long as we do the job on that, people can\\'t catch us. We can charge a little more for it because people are not interested in taking the low bidder. Private labels stalled out in the soft drink business, because people want the Real Thing. [CM: I think the See\\'s candy example has an interesting teaching lesson for all of us. It was the first time we really stepped up for brand quality and it was a hard jump for us ... If they had demanded an extra\\\\u00a0 $100,000 for the See\\'s Candy company, we wouldn\\'t have bought \\'em, and that was after Warren was trained by the best one of the greatest professors of his era ... We just didn\\'t have minds well-enough trained to make an easy decision right. But we did buy it, and as it succeeded we kept learning.

Our volume was bigger than anyone else, and I wouldn\\\\u2019t be surprised if it was bigger than all the rest combined. They did 278 transactions. All done in an office with 29 or 30 people. One of the interesting things about it was that almost all the business was from people who already had insurance from others who are rated AAA. So we pay out only if the muni defaulted AND the bond insurer didn\\\\u2019t pay. We wrote for 2.25% when the original guy charged 1%. This tells you something about AAA in bond insurance in 2008.

We have some experience with Salomon and Gen Re. Charlie saw some things on Salomon\\'s audit committee [that were very risky/questionable]. [CM: In engineering, people have a big margin of safety. But in the financial world, people don\\'t give a damn about safety. They let it balloon and balloon and balloon. It\\'s aided by false accounting. I\\'m more pessimistic than Warren. I\\'ll be amazed if we don\\'t have some kind of significant blowup in next 5-10 years. Derivatives are advertised as shedding risk for the system, but they have long crossed the point of decreasing risk and now increase risk. The truth is that Coca Cola could handle risk [I think he was talking about currency exposure], but now with every company transferring risk to very few players, they are all hugely interdependent. Central banks are exposed to weaknesses. If Salomon had failed, the problems for the rest of the system could have been quite significant. When you start concentrating risk in institutions that are highly leveraged, [watch out]. They have big trading departments with people who make a lot of money. It\\'s not a prediction, it\\'s a warning. - We don\\\\u2019t think that in any year the chance is very high that derivatives will lead to or greatly accentuate a financial trauma, but we think it\\\\u2019s there. It\\\\u2019s fascinating to look at a company like Freddie Mac: an institution that dozens of financial analysts were looking at; that had an oversight office; that was created by Congress with committees to oversee it; that had two smart, exceptional board members,Marty LeibowitzandHenry Kaufman; and that had auditors present \\\\u2013 yet Freddie misstated earnings by $6 billion in a short time.  That\\\\u2019s big money.  And a large part of it was facilitated by derivatives.  You can go back and read the footnotes, listen to the conference calls, etc. and you wouldn\\\\u2019t have known.  In the end, it was $6 billion, but it could have been $12 billion if they\\\\u2019d wanted. Derivatives can lead to a lot of mischief.  When you have a complicated derivative transaction, and a trader with investment house A on one side and investment house B on the other side, and on the day the deal is done, both record a profit, this can lead to mischief \\\\u2013 and the scale is getting bigger every day. I know the managements of many large financial institutions and they don\\\\u2019t have their minds around this.  We tried at Gen Re [where we had a small derivative book] and couldn\\\\u2019t. Whatever problems there were at Salomon [during its crisis years ago], they\\\\u2019re far, far worse now [systemwide]. In 1991, if the government hadn\\\\u2019t reversed himself [in its plans to take actions that would have put Salomon out of business], we were preparing documents [to file for bankruptcy.  Had this happened,] We had $1.2 trillion [notional value] of derivative contracts that others were counting on, that would have gone bad.  All sorts of securities transactions wouldn\\\\u2019t have settled, accounts in Japan and the UK would have been affected, etc.  For instance, Salomon had a relationship with a bank in Germany which took large deposits in Germany and lent the money to Salomon.  All kinds of things would have come out.  You don\\\\u2019t need to put these strains on a system that\\\\u2019s already highly leveraged. When you get huge amounts of transactions, which not many people understand, you create a huge problem that may be triggered by an exogenous event. We use derivatives \\\\u2013 we get them collateralized \\\\u2013 and we\\\\u2019ve made money on them.  But I predict that sometime in the next 10 years, we will have a big problem caused by or exaggerated by derivatives. [CM: People don\\\\u2019t think about the consequences of the consequences.  People start by trying to hedge against interest rate changes, which is very difficult and complicated.  Then, the hedges made the results [reported profits] lumpy.  So then they use new derivatives to smooth this.  Well, now you\\\\u2019ve morphed into lying.  This turns into a Mad Hatter\\\\u2019s Party.  This happens to vast, sophisticated corporations. Somebody has to step in and say, \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re not going to do it  it\\\\u2019s just too hard.\\\\u201d It was bonkers and the accountants sold out.] If you want to have a little fun, go to the annual meeting of a big financial company and ask about the details of a complex transaction.  They won\\\\u2019t know \\\\u2013 but you can be sure the trader who did it will be well paid for it. Any time you have situation where smart people can make money by taking risk, you\\\\u2019ll get it. Derivatives were supposed to spread risk, and some make that argument today.  This may be true much of the time, but what about when risk becomes highly concentrated in a few institutions?  Coke is better able to take currency risk than most trading desks.  Overall, there\\\\u2019s much more risk in the system because of derivatives. [In response to a shareholder who compared super cat reinsurance risk to derivative risk, Buffett responded:] The derivative contracts that Gen Re wrote are not similar to the super cat insurance we\\\\u2019re writing.  We\\\\u2019re reinsuring personal or business risks others don\\\\u2019t want to or are unable to bear.  In our view, it made no sense to be in the derivatives business. [CM: They\\\\u2019re radically different.  Derivatives are full of clauses that say if one party\\\\u2019s credit gets downgraded, then they have to put up collateral.  It\\\\u2019s like margin \\\\u2013 you can go broke.  In attempting to protect themselves, they\\\\u2019ve introduced instability.  Nobody seems to have recognition of what a disaster of a system they\\\\u2019ve created.  It\\\\u2019s a demented system. Had Berkshire not bought Gen Re, which was rated AAA, it could have run into terrible financial difficulty post-9/11, especially if they\\\\u2019d recognized their actual liabilities.  They would have been downgraded, which could have triggered things in derivative activities which would have triggered coming up with loads of cash. The system wasn\\\\u2019t built to last.  Many CEOs at major financial institutions don\\\\u2019t really comprehend that.  When you get margin calls for huge amounts of money, it only has to be one day when you can\\\\u2019t meet it [and you can be forced to file for bankruptcy].  In 1987, there was a large wire transfer that was late arriving at a Chicago brokerage house, and it came close to unraveling the system (the money finally showed up). - [Q - How dangerous are derivatives to the financial system and what can be done to mitigate potential damage from them?] We\\\\u2019ve tried to mitigate it [raise warning flags about the dangers of derivatives] a little by talking about it, but realize there is nothing inherently evil about derivatives. We have at least 60 of them and will be discussing them at our upcoming Berkshire board meeting. Derivatives are expanding rapidly, in more and more imaginative ways. They introduce invisible leverage into the system. In the 1930s, after the crash, the government concluded that leverage contributed to the crash and that it was dangerous. So the U.S. government empowered regulators to deal with this. For decades, they policed it and it was taken seriously when the Fed increased or decreased margin requirements. But the introduction of derivatives has made any regulation of margin requirements a joke. The regulation still exists, but it\\\\u2019s an anachronism. I believe that we may not know when it becomes a super danger or when it will end precisely, but I believe it will go on and increase until very unpleasant things happen because of it. You saw one example of what can happen under forced sales in October 1987. It was driven by portfolio insurance, which was a joke. It was a bunch of stop/loss orders, but done automatically, and it was merchandized. People paid a lot of money for people to teach them how to put in a stop/loss order. When a lot of institutions do this, the effect is pouring gas on a fire. They created a doomsday machine that kept selling and selling. You can have the same thing today because you have fund operators with billions of dollars \\\\u2013 in aggregate, trillions of dollars \\\\u2013 who will all respond to the same stimulus. It\\\\u2019s a crowded trade, but they don\\\\u2019t know it and it\\\\u2019s not formal. They will sell for the same reasons. Someday, you will get a very chaotic situation. As for what could trigger this and when, who knows? Who had any idea that shooting an archduke would start Word War I? Munger: The accounting being enormously deficient contributes to the risk. If you get paid enormous bonuses based on profits that don\\\\u2019t exist, you\\\\u2019ll keep going. What makes it difficult [to stop] is that most of the accounting profession doesn\\\\u2019t realize how stupidly it\\\\u2019s behaving. One person told me the accounting is better because positions are marked to market and said, \\\\u201cDon\\\\u2019t you want real-time information?\\\\u201d I replied that if you can mark to market to report any level of profits you want, you\\\\u2019ll get terrible human behavior. The person replied, \\\\u201cYou just don\\\\u2019t understand accounting.\\\\u201d Buffett: When we went to close out Gen Re\\\\u2019s derivatives book, we took a $400 million loss on a portfolio that was \\\\u201cmarked to market\\\\u201d by the prior management and auditors \\\\u2013 and I\\\\u2019m not criticizing our auditor. Any auditor would have said the same. I wish I could have sold to the auditors instead! Take a dry cleaning business that owes $15. Their books show a $15 accounts payable and the other company shows an offsetting $15 accounts receivable. But there are only four big auditing firms, so in many cases, if they\\\\u2019re auditing my side, the same firm may be valuing or attesting to the value of what\\\\u2019s on the books of the person on the other side. I will guarantee you that if you add up the marks on both sides, they don\\\\u2019t add up to zero. We have 60 or more derivative contracts, and I\\\\u2019ll bet the other side isn\\\\u2019t valuing them like we are. I have no reason to mark the value up \\\\u2013 we don\\\\u2019t get paid for that. If I value it at $1 million on our side, the other side should be marking it at minus $1 million, but I guarantee the numbers are widely different. Auditors should check both sides of derivative trades and the \\\\u201cmarks\\\\u201d should sum to about zero. They don\\\\u2019t. Munger: As sure as God made little green apples, this will cause a lot of trouble. This will go on and on, but eventually will cause a big denouement.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"What are your views on derivatives and how do you think they have affected the global market?\", \"answer\": \"In my 2002 letter to shareholders I referred to them as \\\\u201cweapons of mass destruction.\\\\u201d Derivatives are really just a way to create a product with a very long fuse, for example, 100 years, as opposed to stocks which settle in 3 days. That kind of system allows claims to be built up. AIG called me in September and told me they were about to get downgraded which would have required higher posting requirements. Now this is an enterprise that has been built up over decades and was effectively destroyed in 48 hours by these products. With derivatives, you\\\\u2019re exposed to counterparties and thus reliant on others. These claims built up over time to the tune of billions of dollars and when one falls, the whole system falls. Derivatives are not evil by themselves but rather everyone needs to be able to handle them. System wide, they\\\\u2019re rat poison. Berkshire holds many derivatives but we always hold the money at Berkshire. - [Q: Given the large amount of value that\\\\u2019s been destroyed by the use of derivatives, is it appropriate for Berkshire to hold large derivative positions?] Buffett: Yes, derivatives pose problems to the world. Our job is to make money over time, and our use of derivatives doesn\\\\u2019t impinge on Berkshire\\\\u2019s capital \\\\u2014 we have posted collateral of less than 1% of our total marketable securities. I said in 2002 that we use them. We think that as long as we explain [our use of] derivatives, the benefits outweigh the costs. We received $4.9 billion in premiums [for writing equity puts] and can use this money for 15 \\\\u2013 20 years. I personally think that we\\\\u2019ll make money on our equity put options. We\\\\u2019d have to lose money over 15 \\\\u2013 20 years [to lose on our equity puts]. We had a financial hurricane, [yet regarding] the equity put contracts, there\\\\u2019s a good chance we\\\\u2019ll make money on those. During the last week we modified two put contracts\\\\u2014reducing the term to about 10 years and reducing the strike price from 1,514 to 994. Our shareholders are intelligent enough to understand [the situation] if we explain it. Munger: I would agree that there should be limits, and we have stayed well short of the limit that\\\\u2019s appropriate. [What do you think Ben Graham would think about derivatives?] Buffett: He would not like them. They cause risk to run wild. They increase risks and strains, but if some were mispriced, he\\\\u2019d act accordingly. But he wouldn\\\\u2019t get into a position of letting others get him in trouble. After 1929, Congress decided it was dangerous to borrow against securities, so the Fed was empowered to regulate margin levels. But derivatives made those rules a laughing stock. Derivatives came to be a way around margin regulations. They also allowed longer settlement periods, another danger. Buy Galbraith\\\\u2019s The Great Crash. Munger: There\\\\u2019s a deeper problem. [Concerning derivatives trading] the dealer has two advantages: [1] a croupier-style house advantage, and [2] the dealer plays in the same game and is a better player and knows what the client is doing [buying and selling]. It\\\\u2019s a dirty business. We don\\\\u2019t need more of this kind of thing in America; we need less. - [Q: What useful function do derivatives serve? Why aren\\\\u2019t derivatives illegal?] WB: Charlie may have more to comment. CM: The usefulness of derivatives is overstated. We\\\\u2019d still have oats and wheat if we didn\\\\u2019t have derivative markets. The test is not \\\\u2018is there any benefit\\\\u2019, but is the NET benefit or disadvantage useful or better without. My own view is that if we had only [exchange traded] [Ed: another notetaker heard: agriculture and metals] and banned the rest \\\\u2013 the world would be better place. WB: BNSF has diesel contracts. If I was running the place, I wouldn\\\\u2019t hedge - unless you are smarter than the market in diesel fuel. If you are you shouldn\\\\u2019t be running a railroad, you should be run a diesel trading business. If you have someone in charge of running that hedge, they will hedge it. If he thinks that will make him a better manager of railroads, then fine, let him do it, but I will hold CEO responsible for running it over time. I wouldn\\\\u2019t condemn anyone for hedging diesel fuel. But I do think if you put up (slide4) \\\\u2013 from Chapter 12 of Keynes General Theory \\\\u2013 it is by far the best description of the way capital markets function. It is descriptive and prescriptive. Usually only the first two sentences are quoted, but it is better as a whole paragraph: Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done. The measure of success attained by Wall Street, regarded as an institution of which the proper social purpose is to direct new investment into the most profitable channels in terms of future yield, cannot be claimed as one of the outstanding triumphs of laissez-faire capitalism \\\\u2013 which is not surprising, if I am right in thinking that the best brains of Wall Street have been in fact directed towards a different object. Wall Street is mix of casino and a very important social operation \\\\u2013 and once academia got behind derivatives and schools taught more about how to price a derivative instead of valuing a business, the trouble began. In 1982 Wall Street allowed speculation in SP500 futures. I wrote letter to Congressman Dingle which was published in Fortune Magazine. What I forecasted occurred then it got squared, with new ways to gamble. CM: Warren wrote the only letter saying the idea is insane. Only difference is then not very many people listened to him. WB: It doesn\\\\u2019t make any sense that the tax treatment on gambling on S&P 500 contracts is better (partial long term capital gains treatment) than buying and holding individual stocks for less than a year (SP500 contract is taxed 60% long-term gain and 40% short term, even if you hold it for 60 seconds). This distortion came about as a result of the power of a small group of lobbyists. Charlie do you know why this is? CM: It is neither fair nor sensible. The idea that the tax treatment on something that is held for 3 seconds is different than something that is held for less than a year (some long term gains treatment for the former and none for the latter) is insane. If someone with money and interest cares a lot and others are indifferent, that someone wins in front of the legislative bodies.

To give a lot of options to a CEO who built the business and is in his 60s to incent loyalty is demented. Would the doctors at the Mayo Clinic or the lawyers at Cravath in their 60s work harder if they had options?\\\\\"] If can lead to extremely capricious compensation results that have no link to a person\\'s results. A CEO could simply put money in the bank and grow the business, so there should be a cost of capital factor built into any compensation plan. Also, options should not be issued when the stock is below intrinsic value. [Munger: \\\\\"The theory that options have no cost has contributed to a lot of excesses, which is bad for the country because corporate compensation is perceived as unfair.\\\\\"] Well-fed CEOs are descending on Washington to persuade your Congressmen not to require expensing of options because they\\'d get less. It\\'s sort of shameful. All of the opposition to options comes from people who would get fewer of them. If there was a rule saying the CEO\\'s salary didn\\'t count as an expense [and there was a proposal to rescind this rule], you can bet they\\'d be in there fighting to keep the status quo. [Q: Wouldn\\'t expensing stock options be double counting, since they\\'re already factored into the diluted share count?] No. When you issue options at the market price, there\\'s no dilution until the stock rises, but diluted and basic shares are the same. I don\\'t have any objection to options under certain conditions  I just think they should be recorded as an expense. We\\'ll take options from certain companies in lieu of cash as payment for insurance  even 10-year, 50% out-of-the-money options. [CM: \\\\\"A stock option is both an expense AND dilution. To argue anything else is insane. I\\'d rather make my money playing piano in a whorehouse than account for options as recommended by John Doerr.\\\\\"] \\\\\"Look at Dell. They\\'re buying and selling millions of options, but at the same time people are saying companies don\\'t know how to value them. It\\'s specious. A disconnect. I can figure out what I\\'d pay for an option on a private business, a public company, an apartment house, a farm, etc. EVERY option has value. People that get them understand this better than those that give them. We don\\'t blindly use Black-Scholes; we apply judgment. We would pay something for just about any option. [CM: \\\\\"Black-Scholes works for short-term options, but if it\\'s a long-term option and you think you know something [about the underlying asset], it\\'s insane to use Black-Scholes.\\\\\" Companies will do everything they can to reduce the value of options they grant. We\\'ve sat in on these meetings. They assume that options have a shorter life than they really do, etc. [CM: \\\\\"The only thing that\\'s consistent is that the whole thing is disgusting.\\\\\"]  Charlie and I have thought about options all of our life. My guess is that Charlie was thinking about this in grade school. You don\\'t have to understand Black-Scholes at all, but you have to understand the utility and value of options, and cost of issuing them  a very unpopular topic in some quarters. Let\\'s say you sold a house and you asked for an option on the future appreciation of the house. Wouldn\\'t you say that this option had value? Any option has value, and that\\'s why some people who are kind of slick in business matters get options for nothing or little  far less than market value. The Black-Scholes model is an attempt to measure market value of options. It cranks in various variables, mainly past volatility of the asset involved, which are not the best judge of value. [For example,] Berkshire had a very low beta  experts like to give complex Greek names to simple things  but that doesn\\'t mean the option value to anyone who understood it was lower than another stock with higher volatility. As Charlie said, Black-Scholes can give silly results over longer term. Last year, we made one large commitment in which somebody on the other side was using Black-Scholes and we made $120 million. We love the idea of someone else using mechanistic formulas. They may be right 99% of the time, but we can pass 99 times and only invest the one time they\\'re wrong. [CM: Black-Scholes is a know-nothing system. If you know nothing about value  only price  then Black-Scholes is a pretty good guess at what a 90-day option might be worth. But the minute you get into longer periods of time, it\\'s crazy to get into Black-Scholes. For example, at Costco we issued stock options with strike prices of $30 and $60, and Black-Scholes valued the $60 ones higher. This is insane.] We like this kind of insanity. We will pay you real money if you deliver someone to our office who is willing to offer us three-year options that we can pick and choose from. Options have value. We issued them last year when we sold $400M of bonds. We knew what we were giving up  it had a negative coupon, but options have value. They [other companies] pay people with options, [whereas] we pay with cash bonuses. We\\'d love to not record this expense. Why the opposition? Some people [CEOs] care a lot. They argue that the cost of options is included in the footnotes [of the 10-K], [to which I say] why not pull all expenses in footnotes? Then you could just have two lines on the income statement: sales and the same amount on the next line, profits. It\\'s amazing what people with high IQs will do [for money]. Charlie has a theory [that it\\'s more than money  that it\\'s driven by pride.] [CM: I\\'m so tired of this subject. I\\'ve been on this topic for so long. It\\'s such a rotten way to run a civilization to make the accounting wrong. It\\'s like getting the engineering wrong when making a bridge. When perfectly reputable people say options shouldn\\'t be expensed, it\\'s outrageous.] The auditors swing back and forth. Now four firms [the Big Four accounting firms] that lobbied against options as an expense in 1993 are on the other side. I don\\'t know how this could be [options were not an expense then, but are now, but I\\'m happy to see it]. - Congress has no business legislating accounting.  It was a disgrace when Congress 10 years ago effectively bludgeoned Arthur Leavitt into backing down on expensing stock options, at the behest of big corporate contributors.  In a very significant way, this accelerated the [accounting] abuses of the late 1990s. The Senate voted 88-9 to say that it\\\\u2019s more important to have stock prices go up than to have accurate expenses.  All of the big auditing firms endorsed their big clients\\\\u2019 views, so they could report higher earnings.  They [the auditing firms] have now shifted completely [and support expensing options]. The compromise was the firms were given the choice of expensing options or showing their cost in the footnotes \\\\u2013 and 498 of the S&P 500 companies chose the latter. I suggest that you write to your Congressmen and tell them that FASB knows more about acting than they do. In Google, type in \\\\u201cIndiana\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cpi\\\\u201d and you\\\\u2019ll find a site [here\\\\u2019sone] that relates how, in 1897, the Indiana state legislature voted to round pi to 3.20 because it\\\\u2019s an easier number to work with.  It passed the Indiana House, but by the time it got to the Senate, a few people managed to get it shot down. In 1993, the U.S. Senate cleansed the record of the Indiana House by changing the rules on something they knew nothing about [stock options].  88 senators declared the world was flat because big donors said it was thus.

With copper there was a little shortage and then people got worried [and then the price skyrocketed]. As the old saying goes, \\\\u201cWhat the wise man does in the beginning, fools do in the end.\\\\u201d With any asset class that has a big move, first the fundamentals attract speculation, then the speculation becomes dominant. Once a price history develops and people hear that their neighbor made a lot of money on something, envy sets in and that impulse takes over. We\\\\u2019re seeing that in commodities \\\\u2013 and housing as well. Orgies tend to be wildest toward the end. But you never know when it will end. The eyes of the world that never looked at silver at $1.60 are now looking at it. [The price of silver today is around $14/oz.] My guess today is that copper is responding more to speculative pressures than fundamentals.

And then suddenly the clock strikes 12, and everything turns back to pumpkins and mice. We had a lot of silver at one time, but we don\\\\u2019t have it now. My original decision was that the production and reclamation of silver were running at 100 million ounces less than the consumption. Now a lot of consumption has gone down, for example in photography, but that\\\\u2019s where a lot of reclamation is as well, so it balances out. Silver was out of balance, but there\\\\u2019s now a lot above ground and a huge amount could be removed from other uses, which could increase supply, which is what happened when the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market in the early 1980s [actually 1979-80]. There are few pure silver mines \\\\u2013 most silver is produced as a byproduct from other mining \\\\u2013 so it\\\\u2019s not easy to bring on added production. I thought silver would get tight. I was early and sold early. [To the questioner:] You\\\\u2019re right that a commodity doesn\\\\u2019t earn anything, so unlike a company, in which earnings are accumulating every year, you have to sit with a commodity and hope for a shift in the supply and demand. It\\\\u2019s a big drawback. [CM: We didn\\\\u2019t get where we are by owning non-interest-bearing commodities. It\\\\u2019s a good habit to trumpet your failures and be quiet about your successes.] Well, we have a lot of to trumpet then! [Laughter]  [RE: Investing in silver] I\\\\u2019m not sure who we sold our silver too, but whoever bought it was a lot smarter than I was. I bought it too early and sold it too early, but other than that it was a perfect investment. [Laughter] Charlie had nothing to do with it \\\\u2013 it was all me. Munger: I think we demonstrated how much we know about silver. [Laughter] Buffett: When we bought it, we got a lot of letters about conspiracy theories of one sort or another. Silver responds to supply and demand, like any commodity, which is what determines its price (although the Hunt brothers changed that for a short while and regretted it). [Q - Have you considered investing in metals to protect the company against inflation?] We would not necessarily view metals investing as protection against inflation. The best protection is your own earnings power, whether the currency is in seashells or paper money. A first-class surgeon or teacher will do alright in terms of commanding the earning power of other people. The second best protection is owning a wonderful business, not metals or raw materials or minerals. The truth is, if you own Coca-Cola or Snickers bars or anything that people are going to want to give a portion of their current income to keep getting, and it has low capital-investment requirements, that\\\\u2019s the best investment you can possibly have in an inflationary world. But an inflationary world is not a good thing. We try to own good businesses. I think Berkshire wouldn\\\\u2019t do as well in real terms during periods of high rates of inflation vs. low rates, but we\\\\u2019d probably do better than most businesses. We have no opinion on commodities. If we\\\\u2019re in an oil stock, it means we think it offers a lot of value at this price. If we think oil is going up, we could buy oil futures, which we did once. We think Posco is the best steel company in the world. When we bought it, it was at 4-5x earnings, had a debt-free balance sheet and was the low-cost producer. You can find some businesses with minimal capital investment. See\\\\u2019s Candy does not require much capital investment. It\\\\u2019s a small business, but a wonderful business \\\\u2013 a far better business, adjusted for size, than any steel or oil business. We do everything we can to make it bigger. We do not have a bias toward any commodity-related business. If we have any bias, it\\\\u2019s against.

People talk about a soft landing, but they don\\\\u2019t ever say how. [Current Fed Chairman Ben] Bernanke said he expects a soft landing, but also said there\\\\u2019s the possibility of something worse. One possible outcome is significantly higher inflation. As you owe more and more, it\\\\u2019s tempting to devalue the currency in which the debts were incurred. Munger: Generally speaking, it can\\\\u2019t be good to be running a big current-account deficit and a big fiscal deficit and to have both growing. A great civilization may be able to stand something like that for a longer period than you\\\\u2019d imagine at the outset, but you\\\\u2019d think at the end there\\\\u2019d be a comeuppance and you\\\\u2019d have to adjust and it would be painful. Do you agree Warren? Buffett: Yes. I don\\\\u2019t see how people say it\\\\u2019s sustainable. The longer it goes on, the greater the net debt position builds up and the more people see it. And then something perhaps extraneous causes some big adjustments to take place and the result is chaos, in which currency adjustments play a part. But it\\\\u2019s impossible to predict this. Years ago, portfolio insurance was popular. People were selling this as a sophisticated way to manage money and mitigate risk \\\\u2013 and they earned a lot selling it.

And I think it\\\\u2019s deceptive to see it presented in the footnotes, the way it\\\\u2019s reported, because of the assumptions companies are using in valuing the options. The thinking of these executives goes like this: \\\\u0093\\\\u201c Why should I penalize my shareholders for not doing something that others will do to help theirs?\\\\u0094\\\\u201d And the bad practices become the norm. - [CM: I certainly hope that we\\'re better underwriters than Munich Re.] Let\\'s not name names.

When you buy a stock, you are actually buying a share of that company. If it is a good company then you will make money over time as its value goes up. When you buy a stock, you need to imagine that the stock market will be closed for 20 years and you will not be able to look at its price.

For a long time, most directors were sort of like potted plants. Management had its agenda and didn\\\\u2019t want input on major matters and Charlie and I can testify that we\\\\u2019ve had very little success in influencing big issues. If someone\\\\u2019s spent 20-30 years rising to become CEO, they don\\\\u2019t want a board telling them what to do. It\\\\u2019s changed a little bit today in terms of process. Overwhelmingly, the most important job of the board is to pick the right CEO. If you were on the board of Cap Cities and you hired Tom Murphy, case closed. The second most important job of a board is to prevent the CEO from overreaching. A board should bring independent judgment on acquisitions. There\\\\u2019s a natural tendency for CEOs to want to become bigger by spending other people\\\\u2019s money. The deal is already done by the time the board knows about it. The investment banker comes in and I\\\\u2019ve never seen a banker say, \\\\u201cThis is a dumb idea.\\\\u201d When a significant deal comes along, it\\\\u2019s a chance for the board to weigh in and discuss the economics of what\\\\u2019s going on. But the CEO doesn\\\\u2019t bring a deal unless he wants it done and so he stacks the deck. Munger: I think big deals, on average in America, are contrary to shareholders\\\\u2019 interest. Buffett: In most stock deals, the CEO thinks about what he\\\\u2019s getting, but not what he\\\\u2019s giving. You have to make sure you think about this. I can\\\\u2019t ever think of a discussion [when I was on a board] of weighing what you\\\\u2019re giving away vs. what you\\\\u2019re getting in a stock deal. If more value is being given away, then don\\\\u2019t do it! When I gave away 2% of Berkshire to buy Dexter shoes, it was one of the dumbest things ever. Not 2% of Berkshire then, but 2% of Berkshire today! Munger: Fortunately, you\\\\u2019ve made some good decisions. Buffett: Or half of you wouldn\\\\u2019t be here. It gets swept under the rug. We owned a bank that went to acquire a smaller bank. The CEO of the smaller bank held out for a high price and various terms and conditions and, because he was taking stock, had one last condition for the acquiring bank: \\\\u201cPromise never to do a deal this dumb in the future.\\\\u201d [Laughter] I\\\\u2019ve been on some terrific boards. The best was probably a local business, Data Documents. Every board member had a significant percentage of his net worth in the company and every decision was made for business reasons. In contrast, the standard now is when deal is possible, trot in the investment bankers. I know the answer: they always say, \\\\u201cThis is a great deal.\\\\u201d At Berkshire, almost everyone on the board has a lot of Berkshire stock. They\\\\u2019re in the same position as shareholders. They don\\\\u2019t have D&O [Directors and Officers] insurance and they bought the stock in the open market.

Assuming you\\\\u2019ve been honest with shareholders [in communicating enough information so they can estimate intrinsic value], then if your stock is far below intrinsic value, buying it back adds a lot of value.  The Washington Post did this and Teledyne bought back 90% of its stock over time. Today, stock buybacks are popular.  The underlying rationale \\\\u2013 not the professed rationale \\\\u2013 is that people hope the stock price won\\\\u2019t go down.  But often this doesn\\\\u2019t make sense for shareholders.  If the stock is underpriced, buy it back with excess cash; if it\\\\u2019s overvalued, don\\\\u2019t buy a single share. If we wanted to return cash to shareholders, we\\\\u2019d go to them and say, \\\\u201cOur stock is cheap and we\\\\u2019re going to return cash to you by buying it back.\\\\u201d In terms of dividends, you get into an expectational problem.  Most public companies don\\\\u2019t bounce around their dividend from year to year (although this is very common in private companies and Berkshire subsidiaries) because investors come to rely on it.  So once you establish a dividend policy at a public company, think a long time before changing it. [CM: The total amount paid out in dividends is roughly equal to the amount lost in trading and investment advice, so net dividends to shareholders are zero.  This is a very peculiar way to run a republic.] In a Fortune article I published in 1999 [Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market, 11/99], the frictional costs are equal to the total amount paid out in dividends. Companies should be paying out dividends.  Take See\\\\u2019s Candies: we haven\\\\u2019t figured out a way to grow it, so we can\\\\u2019t reinvest, so something approaching a 100% payout [of profits] would make sense [were it a public company].  Most managements want to ensure regularity [of dividends], so they go with a conservative level [below 100%]. We think about this at Berkshire.  If we didn\\\\u2019t think we could put it [all of our excess cash] to work, then we\\\\u2019d pay it out.  But we expect \\\\u2013 and this is reasonable, I think \\\\u2013 that we will have the chance to put it to work. [If we decided to return cash to shareholders and] if our stock wasn\\\\u2019t underpriced, then we\\\\u2019d probably pay out a dividend \\\\u2013 but don\\\\u2019t count on it anytime soon. - One reason not to pay a dividend is taxes, but we\\\\u2019ve always said that even if we could have paid a tax-free dividend, we would not have done so. Our test has been whether, if we retain a dollar, will it be worth more than a dollar in present value. So far we\\\\u2019ve always passed this test. But it\\\\u2019s no fun sitting on $40 billion, which earned less than 1% last year after tax. The burden of proof will shift in the next few years. We always ask, \\\\u201cCan we use the money effectively within our business?\\\\u201d So far, the answer has been yes. This will be discussed at our board meeting on Monday. - Most of the time, we wouldn\\\\u2019t be able to buy an amount of our stock that would be material to our remaining shareholders. We probably have less opportunity to do so than other large companies. [Buffett then put up this chart, which showed share turnover last year for the following companies: Berkshire Hathaway 14%, Exxon Mobil 76%, General Electric 48%, General Motors 487%, Wal-Mart 79%] Look at these turnover figures. I think Berkshire has lower turnover by some margin than any major company in the U.S. I put Wal-Mart up there because the Walton family owns more of Wal-Mart than I do of Berkshire, so [our low share turnover is] not just because of that. Our shareholders are long-term and loyal owners. We have the most honest-to-god attitude of ownership of any public company. People buy it to own it. It does mean that if it gets cheap, we won\\\\u2019t be able to buy much. But that\\\\u2019s OK. We\\\\u2019re not looking to make money off shareholders by buying them out at a discount. The motivation for buying back stock used to be just because companies thought their shares were cheap. Thirty or forty years ago, it was very fertile to invest in companies that were buying back their stock. The most extreme case was Teledyne \\\\u2013 we made some money investing there. But that\\\\u2019s being swamped today by companies doing it because it\\\\u2019s in fashion or to prop up the stock. The SEC has rules to prevent propping up the stock on a daily basis [but companies still try to do it]. We wouldn\\\\u2019t do it for those reasons. A few years ago, when we were willing to buy back our stock, the fact of writing about it [in the 1999 annual letter, page 16] eliminated the opportunity. [It\\\\u2019s very interesting that Buffett had this slide prepared in advance. I think it\\\\u2019s because he knows his stock is cheap \\\\u2013 we think it\\\\u2019s as cheap as it was on March 10, 2000, the only time he\\\\u2019s ever been willing to buy it back \\\\u2013 and the company is much stronger and has a much brighter outlook than it did then. Buffett no doubt expected that he might catch some flak from shareholders for not announcing a buyback, but rather than addressing that question directly, he chose to deflect it by basically arguing that even if that would be the best use of Berkshire\\\\u2019s capital right now, the stock is too illiquid to buy back much stock anyway. All of this being said, even if the stock were more liquid, I\\\\u2019m not pounding the table for share repurchases in light of the acquisition of Iscar. I\\\\u2019m drooling at the prospect of more acquisitions like this one \\\\u2013 as are, I\\\\u2019m sure, Buffett and Munger.] - [Q - You\\'ve previously encouraged companies to repurchase stock. Please could you address the issue of Berkshire buying back its own shares?] Buffett: My comments go back a lot of years. I haven\\\\u2019t written about other companies repurchasing in about 10 years. Repurchases in recent years were foolish, because they paid too much. They were trying to give out buy recommendations that weren\\\\u2019t justified. In the 1970s and 1980s, we encouraged others to repurchase because [shares] were demonstrably cheaper than anything else. We only felt in 2000 that we wanted to do so, because Berkshire\\\\u2019s intrinsic value [didn\\\\u2019t match] its stock price. But it was self-defeating [the announcement of Buffett\\\\u2019s intention to repurchase sent Berkshire\\\\u2019s stock higher]. [Repurchases] should be quite compelling, and that doesn\\\\u2019t exist now. Ninety percent of repurchases in the last five years were at silly prices and not in the interest of shareholders. Managers did it because it was what everyone else was doing. It\\\\u2019s interesting how many companies bought at two times current prices that aren\\\\u2019t [buying] now.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Why do you not believe in dividends when Benjamin Graham believed in them?\", \"answer\": \"WB: I had to show a little individuality.

The test on dividends is, \\\\u2018can you create more than one dollar of value with the one you retain?\\\\u2019 It would be a mistake for See\\\\u2019s to retain money because they have no ability to use the cash they make to generate a high return internally. We hope to move the capital to a place where it will be worth $1.20. If we do that, taxable or not, they are better off if we retain money. But when the time comes that we don\\\\u2019t think we can use money effectively, we will pay it out. But because we have the ability to redistribute money in a tax-efficient way within the company, we have more reason to retain earnings in the company. We like companies where we have investments to pay to us the money they can\\\\u2019t use effectively. CM: Costco paid no dividend when they were growing rapidly. As St. Augustine said: \\\\u201cGod give me chastity, but not yet.\\\\u201d  [Q - From 2003 through 2008, Berkshire\\\\u2019s market price didn\\\\u2019t increase by the amount of retained earnings, why don\\'t you change Berkshire\\\\u2019s dividend policy?] Buffett: If we had to sell our business on December 31, 2008, we would have had a loss. Reinvested earnings did not produce [gains]. We use book value as a proxy for business value. We measure against the S&P 500\\\\u2014our intrinsic value has never had a five-year period when we underperformed the S&P 500. Munger: I don\\\\u2019t get too excited about these oddball things that come along once in 50 years. I think Wells Fargo [for example] will come out of this mess much stronger. Buffett: In a terrified market, Wells Fargo got to below $9\\\\u2014when aspects of their business were never better, and their business model is fabulous. Pushed by a student, I said that if I had to put all of my money in one stock, it would be Wells Fargo at $9.00. Wells will be a lot better off a couple of years from now than if all this business had never happened, unless they have to issue lots of shares, which they shouldn\\\\u2019t. You never want to be in a position to have to sell [due to a margin call] or emotionally. Why would someone sell Wells Fargo at $9.00 when they bought it at $25.00, and now it\\\\u2019s better off? It\\\\u2019s crazy. I own a farm about 30 minutes from here, and if you own a farm, you don\\\\u2019t get a price on it every day. Look at the asset for value, not the price\\\\u2014as you would with a farm. People let the stock price, not business results, [affect their assessment of a company]. Read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor.

If you\\\\u2019re the only surgeon in town, you\\\\u2019ll be OK [because you can simply raise your prices to keep up with inflation and people will pay it].  Charlie and I think it\\\\u2019s best to own fine businesses that can price in inflationary terms and don\\\\u2019t require big capital investments.  See\\\\u2019s Candies can handle an inflationary world and maintain value. Unfortunately, most businesses will not come out well in real terms.  Earnings might be up, but the business will be compelled to invest more and more dollars into the business to stay in place.  The worst businesses compel you to put more and more in, without any rise in profits. TIPS [Treasury Inflation Protected Securities] are not a bad investment for people worried about inflation heating up, which we\\\\u2019re seeing signs of. [CM: Most people will see declining returns [due to inflation].  One of the great defenses if you\\\\u2019re worried about inflation is not to have a lot of silly needs in your life \\\\u2013 if you don\\\\u2019t need a lot of material goods.] Buffett: Charlie, we\\\\u2019re selling a lot of material goods in the other room, so keep quiet.  [Laughter.] - The talk of deflation was total nonsense. You would think that the trade deficit, which has resulted in a weaker currency, would have led to higher inflation. The price of oil has risen far more in dollars than in euros. So, inflation matters. It\\\\u2019s always there and is something we think about. But See\\\\u2019s Candies will do fine in an inflationary environment. [CM: So far, the weak dollar has acted to restrain inflation.] Yes. For example, we\\\\u2019re paying less for shoes, few of which are made in the U.S. anymore. We don\\\\u2019t want to be long the long bond [e.g., he thinks there\\\\u2019s risk of rising interest rates]. But if you\\\\u2019d told me two years ago what the macro conditions would be today, I\\\\u2019d have been very surprised by where interest rates are today [i.e., he thought they\\\\u2019d be higher]. [CM: There won\\\\u2019t be an automatic correlation between interest rates and inflation \\\\u2013 there will be weird things.] - [Q - An 11-year-old from New Jersey asked how inflation will affect his generation. How is Buffett preparing for inflation?] Buffett: Inflation is going to affect you. Long term, even a small amount is bad. It\\\\u2019s certain we\\\\u2019ll have inflation over time. Volcker opined against an FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] 2% target for inflation. It is something of a slippery slope. Current policies are bound to have inflationary consequences. Inflation is a classic way to reduce the cost of external debt. Federal revenues are going down. Politicians say that taxpayers pay for this or that, but if taxes are less now, who\\\\u2019s paying? The real payers are [those affected by] the shrinkage of the value of the dollar down the road. The people who are really paying are those that are buying fixed income investments now\\\\u2014the Chinese, for example. That\\\\u2019s the ultimate price of stimulus. The easiest thing to do [inflate] is the likeliest. The best protection from inflation is your own earning power. The second best is owning a wonderful business, such as Coke, that doesn\\\\u2019t require capital. With Coke, you\\\\u2019ll get your share of national earnings. Munger: The young man should become a brain surgeon and buy Coke stock, not [government] bonds. Buffett: I get paid by the word. He doesn\\\\u2019t. [laughter] - [PIMCO\\\\u2019s] Bill Gross has written about whether inflation is being captured correctly. If you go out to the Nebraska Furniture Mart, you\\\\u2019ll see that prices haven\\\\u2019t moved up much over time. And in some areas, like DVD players, prices are down 75%, so there\\\\u2019s been deflation. But when I see that \\\\u201ccore\\\\u201d inflation excludes food and energy, I can\\\\u2019t think of anything more core than food and energy. Also, the CPI [consumer price index, the official measure of inflation] uses a computed rental price, but this does not reflect new housing prices. The rental factor has significantly lagged the rise in housing. But if you own your own house and drink Coke, you\\\\u2019re less affected \\\\u2013 my CPI, for example, hasn\\\\u2019t changed very much. But if you\\\\u2019re buying a house and drive 40 miles to work every day, your CPI has gone up a lot. Munger: I see almost no change in the price of the composite product that flows through Costco [Munger is a Director of Costco]. I don\\\\u2019t feel sorry for the people who pay $27 million for an 8,000-square-foot condo in Manhattan. So inflation comes in places. Buffett: Costco\\\\u2019s and Wal-Mart\\\\u2019s LIFO adjustments are almost nothing \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s inconsequential. [LIFO stands for \\\\u201clast-in, first-out\\\\u201d, and means that when a product is sold from inventory, its cost is based on the price paid for the latest such items purchased by the company. If the cost of the product is rising rapidly, this can cause the old inventory to become valued at less than the current market cost, necessitating a LIFO adjustment. In contrast, if there\\\\u2019s no inflation, the LIFO adjustment is nil.] You\\\\u2019re dealing with $200 some billion in sales at Wal-Mart and the LIFO adjustment would pick up any inflation [but it\\\\u2019s not there]. In our jewellery stores, there have been big LIFO adjustments recently. It\\\\u2019s the same with our steel operations. Carpet prices went nowhere for 20 years, but because it\\\\u2019s petroleum based, it\\\\u2019s moved up a lot recently and now we have $100 million or so in LIFO adjustments. Overall, for a typical young family, the CPI probably understates inflation in terms of their living situation. - [Q - Inflation problem you talked about in 2008 letter, but you didn\\\\u2019t mention inflation in 2009 letter. Why?] WB: I may be biased, as I have always worried about inflation. And there has been a lot of inflation. I was born in 1930 and the dollar is down 90% since then but we\\\\u2019ve done okay. I think prospects for inflation around world have increased.Situations that governments have been forced into or allowed to embrace may cause it. Weaning ourselves from medicine may be harder than original illness, there is massive debt. I don\\\\u2019t see any way countries running high debt to GDP over time doesn\\\\u2019t have diminution of currency over time. I wrote OpEd in NYT last year. I would bet on higher inflation, and maybe a lot higher. CM: Again, I agree. [Q - What are key metrics you look for on inflation, and catalysts for a future rise?] WB: You give me credit for more brainpower than I actually bring to the question. You can\\\\u2019t look at any metric. If it gets going, it creates its own dynamic and is very hard to stop. We saw it in 1970s until Volcker came in with a sledge hammer. Prime rate was at 21% and governments up to 15%. We had a demonstration project 30 yrs ago. If we continue today\\\\u2019s policies, something like that could be possible. Trend is not destiny. We have power to control our future. We do it through elected representatives If inflation gets into saddle, faith in institutions could break down. Currencies are a poorer bet than they have been in a long time but I do not know what that means for the near future. Remember that your money can be inflated away but your talent cannot. As long as you are the best at what you do you will be entitled to your portion of profits. CM: Contribute the most to civilization and counter the effects of inflation. To outsmart others isn\\\\u2019t the best way to do it. If you are best painter or best brain surgeon, you will always command your share of the economy around you. Talent is terrific asset to deal with it.

[CM: This accounting change is typical of Berkshire. We\\'re so horrified by aggressive accounting [that is rampant in Corporate America] that we reach for ways to be conservative. It helps our business decisions and protects Berkshire. How did we get in situation where we\\'re all so close to the line?] I felt much more comfort working with financial statements in the 1960s than today. There was more information then, even through there was less disclosure. In the case of Gen Re, [having overly aggressive] Workman\\'s Comp reserves was a quick fix, but it\\'s like heroin.

[In a news conference on Sunday, Buffett was quoted as saying: \\\\\"You would be amazed how compliant auditors have been in the past decade, not only co-operating but suggesting techniques for making numbers less useful  less truthful  to investors.\\\\\"] The real problem is [accounting for] pension and healthcare liabilities. I\\'ve looked at companies recording pension income of hundreds of millions [of dollars] when their pension plan is underfunded by billions [of dollars]. It\\'s the same mentality as stock options.

But we are capped, which is a good thing because asbestos continues to explode. Last year, we said it would be worse than anyone expected and it has been and will continue to be. Many companies thought to be insulated are being dragged in. Asbestos is actually creating some opportunities for Berkshire to buy companies that went bankrupt due to asbestos claims  free of asbestos liabilities. We probably wouldn\\'t own Johns Manville were it not for asbestos. It\\'s a cancer on the American corporate world and it\\'s growing. [CM: \\\\\"Asbestos has morphed into a situation with enormous amounts of fraud, etc. People with serious injuries are being hurt [as more and more money flows to the plaintiff\\'s bar and claimants with no current injuries]. The Supreme Court has practically invited Congress to step in, but Congress has refused due to the influence of the trial lawyers. I\\'d be surprised if there\\'s a constructive solution in the next five years. I expect there will just be more of the current mess. There was a solution, but the Supreme Court didn\\'t allow it. We\\'ve very careful to avoid asbestos liabilities. I\\'m not worried about our insurance companies [via-a-vis their exposure to asbestos]. You have a plaintiff\\'s bar  going beyond asbestos  that will take any human adversity and try to make a profit out of it by suing those with deep pockets. - [CM: What\\\\u2019s happened in asbestos is that a given group of people get mesothelioma \\\\u2013 a horrible cancer that comes only from asbestos exposure and kills people.  Then, there\\\\u2019s another group of claimants who smoked two pack of cigarettes a day and have a spot on their lung.  Then you get a lawyer who gets a doctor to testify that every spot is caused by asbestos.  Once you effectively bribe a doctor, then you can get millions of people to sue on fears of getting cancer. But there\\\\u2019s not enough money [to pay all of the claimants], so people who are truly harmed don\\\\u2019t get enough.  In a southern state with a jury pool that hates all big companies [you get big judgments], but lawyers are stealing money from people who are hurt and giving it to people who aren\\\\u2019t entitled.  It\\\\u2019s a bonkers system, but with federalism [state\\\\u2019s rights], there\\\\u2019s no way to stop it.  The Supreme Court refused to step in. TheManville[Personal Injury Settlement] Trust [created when Johns Manville went into bankruptcy; it separated the operating company from the asbestos liabilities; Berkshire bought the operating company and the proceeds went into the trust to pay asbestos claims] had more new claims last year than in any year \\\\u2013 and the company last mined and sold asbestos 35 years ago. Trying to buy people off is like trying to put out a fire by dousing it with gasoline.  With word processors, lawyers can easily produce countless claimants.  But only 25% of the money goes to claimants \\\\u2013 the rest goes to the lawyers, doctors, etc. The only people who can fix it are the Supreme Court or Congress.  The Supreme Court \\\\u2013 some people would say rightly \\\\u2013 refused to get involved [but I say] they chickened out.  And Congress, given the politics, has yet to step in. There\\\\u2019s an important lesson here: Once wrong-doers get rich, they get enormous political power and you can\\\\u2019t stop it, so the key is to nip things like this in the bud. It would be easy to fix the problem: the right way is to say we\\\\u2019re not going to pay off all these little claims.] We own Johns Manville and their behavior was reprehensible. [CM: Johns Manville\\\\u2019s behavior was one of the worst in the history of Corporate America \\\\u2013 they knew asbestos hurt people and covered it up to make more money.] We have no connection to this.  The Manville Trust has billions of dollars and has been around for close to 20 years. It didn\\\\u2019t have a record number of claims last year due to new injuries.  Rather, it\\\\u2019s a honey pot. But they\\\\u2019re only paying 5% on claims, so the guy who\\\\u2019s been drastically injured is only getting a small amount.  It\\\\u2019s not the right way to do it. Regarding the proposed legislation [in Congress]: in the end, we didn\\\\u2019t support it.  It wasn\\\\u2019t the answer we needed. The Supreme Court, when they ducked it, they left a problem that will be around for decades and decades. [CM: If you want to be cynical, look at the perjury.  There are only three solvent companies left [facing asbestos claims], so [surprise!] plaintiffs can only remember those three names [when recalling which products they were exposed to decades ago].  It\\\\u2019s a case of perjury being suborned by practicing lawyers.] - [CM: There\\\\u2019s been terrible behavior by doctors, terrible behavior by lawyers, gutless behavior by courts, and even more gutless behavior by politicians, who [he said something disparaging about them]. You keep hoping that it will get so bad that things will change, that reform will happen. And it can happen: for example, the Workman\\\\u2019s Comp system in California. With the Schwarzenegger revolution in California, it\\\\u2019s been partly \\\\u2013 maybe 15% \\\\u2013 corrected. If it gets bad enough, it\\\\u2019s possible that it could be fixed. It\\\\u2019s crazy that judges give money to people who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for their entire lives, are dying, and have one little spot on their lungs. Even asbestos will eventually go away, but who knows how much damage will be done before the storm passes.

It\\'s ruined a lot of people. You can go broke doing it. You\\'ll see way more stocks that are dramatically overvalued than dramatically undervalued. It\\'s common for promoters to cause a stock to become valued at 5-10 times its true value, but rare to find a stock trading at 10-20% of its true value. So you might think short selling is easy, but it\\'s not. Often stocks are overvalued because there is a promoter or a crook behind it. They can often bootstrap into value by using the shares of their overvalued stock. For example, it it\\'s worth $10 and is trading at $100, they might be able to build value to $50. Then, Wall Street says, \\\\\"Hey! Look at all that value creation!\\\\\" and the game goes on. [As a short seller,] you could run out of money before the promoter runs out of ideas.\\\\\" Everything we\\'ve ever thought about shorting worked out eventually, but it\\'s very painful. It\\'s a whole lot easier to make money on the long side. You can\\'t make big money shorting because the risk of big losses means you can\\'t make big bets. [Munger: \\\\\"Being short and seeing a promoter take the stock up is very irritating. It\\'s not worth it to have that much irritation in your life.\\\\\"] We would never short anyway because we\\'re too big. - [CM: \\\\\"It\\'s dangerous to short stocks.\\\\\"] \\\\\"Charlie and I have agreed on around 100 stocks over the years that we thought were shorts or promotions. Had we acted on them, we might have lost all of our money, every though we were right just about every time. A bubble plays on human nature. Nobody knows when it\\'s going to pop, or how high it will go before it pops. A.W. Jones, which had a long-short model, developed the best-known hedge fund in the late 1950s and early 1960s. They were market neutral, but didn\\'t stick with it. Something went wrong with A.W. Jones. A very high percentage of its spin-off funds bit the dust. There were suicides and people lost their fortunes and had to drive cabs. Ben Graham didn\\'t find shorting particularly successful. Quite a high percentage of his paired investments worked, but he lost a lot on the few he lost on. I had a harrowing experience shorting a stock in 1954. I wouldn\\'t have been wrong over 10 years, but I was very wrong after 10 weeks, which was the relevant period. My net worth was evaporating. Shorting is just tough. You must bet small. You can\\'t short the whole company. It takes just one to kill you. As it rises, it consumes more and more money. - There\\\\u2019s nothing evil about short selling. There are people on the short side who have done things to make some stocks go down \\\\u2013 some of which is appropriate and some of which is inappropriate. People do that on the long side as well, so I have no ax to grind with short sellers. We have no problem with anyone shorting Berkshire stock. There\\\\u2019s nothing I\\\\u2019d like more than to be paid to lend my stock to shorts. I do think it\\\\u2019s a very tough way to make a living, both financially and psychologically. If you buy something at $20, you can lose $20. If you short at $20, you\\\\u2019re loss can be infinite. As you know, we have a friend who\\\\u2019s been outspoken on naked shorting [referring to Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who used to be President and CEO of Berkshire subsidiary Fechheimer Brothers]. I don\\\\u2019t have a great problem with it. If anyone wants to do that with Berkshire, more power to \\\\u2018em. Companies with a large short interest very often have been revealed as frauds or semi- frauds \\\\u2013 not the one my friend runs. Over the years, I\\\\u2019ve probably had 100 ideas of things to short and I would have eventually been right [on almost all of them]. But [because it\\\\u2019s so hard to get the timing right,] I likely wouldn\\\\u2019t have made much money and there would have been a huge opportunity cost. Someone who\\\\u2019s running a fraud is probably very good at it and can keep it going a long time. I would never put money with a short fund \\\\u2013 not because I have any problem with it ethically, but because I question if they could make money over time. [CM: It would be one of the most irritating experiences in the world to do a lot of work to uncover a fraud and then watch it go from X to 3X and watch the crooks happily partying with your money while you\\\\u2019re meeting margin calls. Why would you want to go within hailing distance of that? [Laughter]]  I\\\\u2019ve never been in a position to ask a broker from whom I\\\\u2019ve bought to deliver the shares and not had it happen. I don\\\\u2019t see the problem of people shorting stocks, assuming they\\\\u2019re not manipulating the market. I would welcome people wanting to short Berkshire. In fact, I\\\\u2019d lend them stock and earn extra income. They\\\\u2019re a certain future buyer. If anyone wants to naked short Berkshire, they can do it until the cows come home. In fact, we\\\\u2019ll hold a special meeting for them. [Laughter] The shorts generally have a tougher time of it in this world. More people are bullish on stocks. It\\\\u2019s a tough way to make a living. It\\\\u2019s very easy to spot a phony stock or a heavily promoted stock, but it\\\\u2019s hard to say when it will turn. If it\\\\u2019s trading at five times its intrinsic value, there\\\\u2019s no reason it can\\\\u2019t trade at ten times. I don\\\\u2019t see shorts as any great threat to the world. If a lot of people want to short your stock, they have to pay you [for the borrow]. We did this with USG. One large brokerage firm approached us [about lending out our stock] and we were happy to do this. We charged them a lot. We even forced them to hold it for a certain period of time so we could continue to earn money on the borrow. Munger: There\\\\u2019s tremendous slop in the clearance process. It\\\\u2019s not good for a civilization. It\\\\u2019s like having slop in the management of your nuclear power plants. Buffett: If I buy 1,000 shares of GM and ask my broker to deliver it and he doesn\\\\u2019t, what\\\\u2019s the situation? Munger: If you\\\\u2019re a private customer, you have to wait a while. There\\\\u2019s a lot of slop in derivative trading. Buffett: But can\\\\u2019t I take my broker to court after three weeks? Munger: I don\\\\u2019t think that there\\\\u2019s any court that can give you a stock certificate just because you want it.  [Q - What do you think of short sellers being investigated for being publicly bearish and short selling companies? Is short selling healthy? Is a healthy discussion between bulls and bears healthy for the markets?] Buffett: There is nothing wrong with people who are positive or negative speaking out as long as they are responsible for what they say. You can do things on the long or short side that are unethical or illegal. Anytime you attack conventional wisdom though, you will get a lot of negative feedback. When he and Charlie criticized the EMH (Efficient Market Hypothesis), it was so widely accepted people didn\\\\u2019t like their comments. In general he has no problem with short selling. Munger: For the most part we are criticizing the wrong people (the short sellers). The people the criticisms should go to are the accountants who allowed the bad accounting should be held in the dock.

It is demented to allow derivative trading such that clearance risks are embedded in the system. Assets are all \\\\u201cgood until reached for\\\\u201d on balance sheets. We had $400 million of that at General Re, \\\\u201cgood until reached for\\\\u201d. In the drug business, you must prove it is good. It is a crazy culture, and to some extent, an evil culture. Accounting people really failed us. Accounting standards ought to be dealt with like engineering standards. WB: Salomon [Salomon Brothers during the 1991 scandal] was trading with Marc Rich who had fled the country. They said they wanted to keep trading with him. Only by total directive could we stop it. I think the Fed did the right thing with Bear [Stearns]. They would have failed on Sunday night, and walked to a bankruptcy judge. They had $14.5 trillion of derivative contracts \\\\u2014 not as bad as it sounds, but the parties that had those contracts would have been required to undo the contracts to establish the liability from the estate. With the $400 million at Gen Re, we had 4-5 years. At Bear, it would have been 4-5 hours. It would have been a spectacle. Two of the witnesses at the testimony said, \\\\u2018we understood we couldn\\\\u2019t borrow unsecured, but we didn\\\\u2019t understand we couldn\\\\u2019t borrow secured.\\\\u2019 The world does not have to lend you money. If they don\\\\u2019t want to lend you money, an extra 10 basis points won\\\\u2019t make a difference. It depends on people\\\\u2019s willingness to lend you money, which comes down to how other people feel about you.

Our real GDP per capital rose seven-fold in the last century, which is remarkable. Sure, the big consumer debt load and trade deficit could cause some financial market distress \\\\u2013 there are great investment opportunities in dislocations \\\\u2013 but the country will survive. Eventually the country will do fine, but there\\\\u2019s a significant possibility of a chaotic situation. [CM: We don\\\\u2019t have any great record making macroeconomic predictions. It\\\\u2019s obvious that we could have some kind of convulsion however.] Far greater sums in one asset class after another are on a hair trigger. We\\\\u2019re piling up huge financial assets at intermediaries, which lend themselves to huge dislocations. We\\\\u2019ve turned over huge amounts of money to people who want to beat the S&P in the short term, and while they may appear to be independent, their actions are not independent. They can all try to head to the exits at the same time. But if you\\\\u2019re selling, you must find a buyer. The only way to sell a burning seat in the theater is to find someone else to buy it. [CM: There\\\\u2019s way heavier leverage by hedge funds and [others] today. I knew a guy who had $5 million and owned his house free and clear. But he wanted to make a bit more money to support his spending, so at the peak of the internet bubble he was selling puts on internet stocks. He lost all of his money and his house and now works in a restaurant. It\\\\u2019s not a smart thing for the country to legalize gambling [in the stock market] and make it very accessible.] Is there anyone we\\\\u2019ve forgotten to offend? We don\\\\u2019t want to miss anyone. (Laughter) [Q - Risks in the Global Financial System?] Charlie and I are not as on board on this, so I\\\\u2019ll answer it and then Charlie can share his thoughts. We have a $618 billion trade deficit and an even larger current account deficit. As large as we are, something will change [for the worse] and the longer it goes on, the worse it will be. Most economists say a soft landing is likely, but they don\\\\u2019t say what this [will look like]. How the numbers come down is quite significant. Paul Volcker has expressed apprehension about [the likelihood of] a soft landing. There\\\\u2019s as high a percentage as there\\\\u2019s ever been of money on a hair trigger \\\\u2013 in foreign exchange, stocks, bonds, the carry trade... When people go to bed at night \\\\u2013 an electronic herd \\\\u2013 that can sell billions of dollars at the press of a key. I think this is at an all-time high. An exogenous event, like Long Term Capital Management \\\\u2013 and it will happen \\\\u2013 could trigger a stampede. If you hold dollars, you can\\\\u2019t get rid of them. You can\\\\u2019t sell them to the U.S., because you\\\\u2019d get dollar-denominated assets in return. And you can\\\\u2019t sell them to another country, like France [I forget the reason he gave]. [He read a quote from Paul Volcker\\\\u2019s recent article in the Washington Post and concluded:] The situation is dangerous and intractable and is at an all-time high. But I can\\\\u2019t predict the timing. I would say that what\\\\u2019s going on with the trade deficit will have serious consequences. But in the last Presidential race, neither candidate addressed it, which is understandable. 90% of the American people can\\\\u2019t define \\\\u201ccurrent account\\\\u201d and it\\\\u2019s hard to describe in three minutes. And it\\\\u2019s not the kind of issue that Betty [the average American voter], when she\\\\u2019s making her toast in the morning, asks herself, \\\\u201cGee, that trade deficit is really unsettling me today.\\\\u201d Charlie has a different view. Charlie? [CM: If anything, I\\\\u2019m a little more repelled by the lack of virtue in how we as a nation run our financial affairs. Look at consumer credit... Things could get a lot worse.] How do you think it will end? [CM: Badly.] We\\\\u2019re like an incredibly rich family. We sit on the porch of our huge farm \\\\u2013 so big that we can\\\\u2019t even see the end of it \\\\u2013 and each year, we consume 6% more than the farm produces. To pay for this, each year we sell or mortgage a little bit of the farm that we can\\\\u2019t see, so we don\\\\u2019t even notice. We\\\\u2019re very, very rich and the rest of the world is happy to buy from us or lend to us, so each year they take a piece of our valuable assets \\\\u2013 and they work very hard. But we will have to service this. If it goes on for a long time, our children will pay. We\\\\u2019re sending $2 billion per day [overseas right now]. What will cause a crisis? I don\\\\u2019t know. Does it reach a tipping point, or will there be an exogenous event? I have a hard time conceiving of any scenario in which the dollar appreciates. [CM: The counter-argument is: what does it matter if foreigners own 10% of us over time, if the pie grows by 30%? [But I don\\\\u2019t buy this. Taken to its logical extreme,] what if we had no manufacturing and our only businesses were hedge funds?] Imagine that if, instead of fighting the Revolutionary War, we\\\\u2019d instead agreed to give Britain 3% of our GDP each year.

We got involved with Fruit of the Loom first by buying the bonds. Munger: I think much of [how bankruptcy is handled] is pretty horrible. It\\\\u2019s a situation where courts themselves have gone into the business of bidding to attract bankruptcy proceedings. They\\\\u2019ve found that if they develop a process in which they over-pay people (lawyers, etc.), they can attract the most cases. It\\\\u2019s so upsetting to watch that I don\\\\u2019t follow it as much as I should. I\\\\u2019m an old man and I don\\\\u2019t like to have an upset stomach. [Laughter] Buffett: We bought a lot of the Enron bonds called Ospreys. The Ospreys were a complex situation and we considerably more than tripled our money. In other situations, we got outbid, like with Burlington and Sitel. We owed all of the Sitel bonds, though, so we came out fine. Anytime there\\\\u2019s something big and complicated, there might be some mispricing. But recently, [the mispricing has] been on the high side.

In reinsurance, in which we are a big player, there are great variances. For marine risks on the Gulf Coast (rigs, etc.), prices are up dramatically, as they should be. Premiums paid for this type of risk were $2.5 billion and the payouts were $15 billion [so obviously the pricing wasn\\\\u2019t sufficient]. In the past few years, we\\\\u2019ve been the largest writer of mega-cat insurance in the world, and I\\\\u2019m sure we will be this year. Prices are up a lot, but we don\\\\u2019t know if exposures are up even more. We don\\\\u2019t know if the experience of the last two years [the worst hurricanes in U.S. history] is to be relied upon more than the past 100 years. They tell you two different things. We do know that it would be silly to assume that the past two years [are outliers]. Atmospheric conditions and water temperatures have changed. This could change the propensity of hurricanes to occur and their severity. If the last two years are relevant [e.g., become the norm], then we\\\\u2019re not getting paid enough [for the reinsurance we\\\\u2019re writing currently]. The scary possibility is that the changes are continuous and that the changes in the past two years build up. It gets into chaos theory, whereby the output is not a linear relationship. You could dream up some very scary scenarios. We are willing to write in certain areas and with certain coverages because we can sustain the losses. We\\\\u2019re willing to sustain big losses because [we have the financial strength and think we\\\\u2019re getting paid enough]. But it\\\\u2019s not like flipping a coin or rolling dice \\\\u2013 there are many changing variables. In the third quarter, we will have a lot of exposure to wind [damage claims] \\\\u2013 but not as much as a couple of years ago. Prices are hardening in that particular area. If the prices go back to what they were last year, [we will write a lot less]. We don\\\\u2019t believe in modeling. The modelers don\\\\u2019t know a thing. It\\\\u2019s silly. We get paid for making guesses on it. Over a lifetime, we\\\\u2019ll know if we were right. Even if there are low losses this year, we won\\\\u2019t know if we\\\\u2019re right. It\\\\u2019s still a business we like. If there\\\\u2019s a super-super catastrophe, say $250 billion (four times Katrina), we would pay maybe $10 billion. We could pay, and comfortably pay, but many others in the industry would be in trouble. Over 5-10 years, we\\\\u2019ll know how well we did. [CM: The record of the past, if you average it out, has been quite respectable. Why shouldn\\\\u2019t we use our capital strength to get into volatile areas that make others uncomfortable? We\\\\u2019re getting close to 10% of the float of the American property and casualty insurance industry, so we can\\\\u2019t continue to grow as fast as we have, but it will be attractive. I\\\\u2019m aware of the risks like pandemics \\\\u2013 you\\\\u2019re aware of them too \\\\u2013 and we get offers every day. We think about $20 billion or $50 billion events and up. It\\\\u2019s a question of making judgments of whether we\\\\u2019re getting paid enough. We\\\\u2019ll know in 30 years. If we have a lot of money then, we\\\\u2019ll know we were right. If we take a big loss this year, it doesn\\\\u2019t mean we are wrong. What will hurricane losses be in 10 years? I don\\\\u2019t know, but I\\\\u2019ll keep thinking about it every day.

We\\\\u2019ve not made our money betting on macro stuff like foreign exchange; instead, it\\\\u2019s from buying cheap stocks like PetroChina. 25 years ago, we saw the same thing [a real estate bubble] with Nebraska farmland. People fled cash, saying \\\\u201ccash is trash.\\\\u201d A farm 30 miles north of here sold for $2,000/acre in 1980; I bought it later for $600/acre. People went crazy and the consequences were huge. Many banks failed, even ones that had survived the Great Depression. I don\\\\u2019t know where we are with housing \\\\u2013 people may behave differently because they live in it. But when you get prices increasing at a far greater rate than construction costs or inflation [there can be problems]. [CM: In parts of California and in the Washington DC suburbs, there\\\\u2019s a bubble.] I sold a house in Laguna Beach, CA for $3.5 million. The house was only worth about $500,000, so the land was being valued at $3 million. It was only a fraction of an acre, so the land was being valued at $60 million per acre. That\\\\u2019s a pretty fancy price for almost any land. [CM: One of the Directors of Wesco told me that a modest house next to his recently sold for $27 million. There are some very extraordinary housing price bubbles going on and the consequences could be serious.] The financing terms have become easier and easier as prices have risen, which is contrary to normal [and prudent] practices. But the financing process has become so disintermediated that the mortgage buyer doesn\\\\u2019t care. The easier financing has led to a boom in prices. The Nebraska farm bubble was fueled by banks that historically had been conservative but went crazy. They said that a farm was an asset-appreciation investment, not an income investment \\\\u2013 in other words, they were playing the greater fool game. The rest of the world is saving. They\\\\u2019re investing $2 billion/day in the U.S. Some say they have so much confidence in the U.S. that they want to invest, but this is silly. They invest because they have to. [CM: It\\\\u2019s obvious that easy financing [for houses] is fueling big price increases.] Consider the following fanciful illustration. Let\\\\u2019s say we had a fixed population in Omaha and no new houses were built, but each year everyone sold their house to their neighbor and moved. In year one, the price was $100,000. In year two, the price jumped to $150,000, but Fannie and Freddie guaranteed the mortgage and sold it to Asian investors. This is an influx of $50,000 to the family income. In year three, the price jumps to $200,000 and the same thing happens. Obviously, it is transparent what\\\\u2019s happening here, so it wouldn\\\\u2019t really happen, but you can have accidental behavior that leads to certain aspects of this. [CM: There are Ponzi effects in any economy, and you can see that here.] [CM: In a corporation like Berkshire, a subchapter C, owning real estate is very disadvantageous. Investing in real estate is having a bubble of its own. My friends who own real estate are selling their worst assets and getting better prices than they\\\\u2019d imagined.] I have less than 1% of my net worth outside Berkshire and when the Nasdaq hit its high, I had nearly all of it in REITs, which were selling at a discount to their liquidation values. REITs are quite attractive now, especially compared with 5-6 years ago when they were very unpopular. It\\\\u2019s better to pay attention to something being scorned than championed. Munger: And REIT accounting is phony. Buffett: Other than that, we love REITs. (Laughter)  Munger: Some of the worst sins in manufactured-housing financing have gone over to the financing of stick-built homes. A lot of ridiculous credit is being extended in the U.S. housing sector. There was a horrible aftermath in manufactured housing and my guess is that we\\\\u2019re likely to see something similar [as a result of the unwise credit being extended in the overall housing sector]. Buffett: Look at the latest 10-Qs of financial institutions and the levels of accrued, but not paid, interest. You\\\\u2019ll see some interesting things. It\\\\u2019s growing rapidly, which means the lenders are booking earnings, but not receiving the cash [e.g., borrowers are falling behind in their payments]. Dumb lending always has its consequences. You can have an epidemic and not realize it until you\\\\u2019re very far into it. You had it in commercial real estate in the 1980s and the RTC [Resolution Trust Corporation] was the result. A developer will build anything he can get financing for. Munger: Some of the dumb lending is facilitated by contemptible accounting. The accounting profession [has continued to disgrace itself here]. Buffett: We developed a piece of property for 20 years in California. Munger: I think we got our money out, plus interest [e.g., a terrible rate of return, given the time and effort]. Buffett: It\\\\u2019s not an exaggeration. The land value was $5-6 million when we sold. We finished at the wrong time. What do you think it would be worth now, Charlie? Munger: $100 million. Buffett: The swing in property values has been huge in some markets. What we see in our residential brokerage business [HomeServices of America, the nation\\\\u2019s second- largest realtor] is a slowdown everywhere, most dramatically in the formerly hottest markets. The high end and where properties were bought for investment and speculation are doing the worst. If you buy a house for $300,000 and take a $270,000 mortgage, you\\\\u2019re going to stay there and continue to make your mortgage payments, even if the market value of the house falls (unless something bad happens to you like losing your job). But if you have investors and speculators holding the properties \\\\u2013 effectively day traders in the condo market \\\\u2013 that kind a speculation can produce a market that can move in a big way. First the buying and selling stops and then the market reopens. With stocks, they will trade every day, so you can\\\\u2019t kid yourself. If you own GM stock and it\\\\u2019s down on Monday, you know you\\\\u2019ve taken a loss. But in housing, there\\\\u2019s always the hope that you can find the one seller who will pay the price you want, who hasn\\\\u2019t heard that the market has collapsed.

The mortgage back securities are just not moving, commercial, not residential mortgage backs. But I think you are directing your question at equities probably. The equities, if you leave out the corporate form, have been a lousy way to own equities. You have interjected a corporate income tax into something that people individually have been able to own with a single tax, and to have the normal corporate form you have a double taxation in there. You really don\\'t need it and it takes too much of the return. REITS have, in effect, created a conduit so you don\\'t get the double taxation, but they also generally have fairly high operating expenses. If you get real estate, let\\'s just say you can buy fairly simple types of real estate at an 8% yield, or thereabouts, and you take away close to 1% to 1.5% by the time you count stock options and everything, it is not a terribly attractive way to own real estate. Maybe the only way a guy with a $1,000 or $5,000 can own it but if you have $1 million or $10 million, you are better off owning the real estate properties yourself instead of sticking some intermediary in between who will get a sizable piece of the return for himself. So we have found very little in that field. You will see an announcement in the next couple of weeks that may belie what I am telling you today. I don\\'t want you to think I am double crossing you up here. But generally speaking we have seen very little in that field that gets us excited. People sometimes get very confused aboutthey will look at some huge land company, like Texas Pacific Land Trust, which has been around over 100 years and has got a couple of million acres in Texas. And they will sell 1% of their land every year and they will take that (as income? Garbled) and come up with some huge value compared to the market value. But that is nonsense if you really own the property. You can\\'t move. You can\\'t move 50% of the properties or 20% of the properties, it is way worse than an illiquid stock. So you get these, I think, you get some very silly valuations placed on a lot of real estate companies by people who really don\\'t understand what it is like to own one and try to move large quantity of properties. REITS have behaved horribly in this market as you know and it is not at all inconceivable that they become a class that would get so unpopular that they would sell at significant discounts from what you could sell the properties for. And they could get interesting as a class and then the question is whether management would fight you in that process because they would be giving up their income stream for managing things and their interests might run counter to the shareholders on that. I have always wondered about REITS that have managements they say their assets are so wonderful, and they are so cheap and then they (management) go out and sell stock. There is a contradiction in that. They say our stock is very cheap at $28 and then they sell a lot of stock at $28 less an underwriting commission. There is a disconnect there. But it is a field we look at. Charlie and I can understand real estate, and we would be open for very big transactions periodically. If there was a LTCM situation translated to real estate, we would be open to that, the trouble is so many other people would be too that it would unlikely go at a price that would get us really get us excited.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Where do you see the residential real estate market going in the next year or two?\", \"answer\": \"Buffett: We don\\\\u2019t know. I see a lot of data. In the last few months, you\\\\u2019ve seen a real pick up in activity in California in the low to medium-priced homes at or below $750,000. There are many different markets, and many California markets will be difficult. There\\\\u2019s been no bounce in prices yet, though activity is up on lower prices. Looking at real estate brokerage data, it looks like something close to stability in California in the $750,000 and less segment at these much reduced prices. Mortgages being put on books today are much better than before. Interest rates are down and it\\\\u2019s easier to make payments. It\\\\u2019s improving. There are about 1.3 million households created in a year, but in a recession it tends to be lower. If you create 2.0 million houses a year, then you run into trouble. There\\\\u2019s an excess inventory of about 1.5 million now. With housing starts down to 500,000 [annual rate], the excess supply will be absorbed. We are eating up the excess at a rate of 700,000 \\\\u2013 800,000 units per year. It takes a couple of years.

There will be consequences for these people, but the question is whether it spreads. If unemployment and interest rates don\\\\u2019t go up, then it\\\\u2019s unlikely this factor alone triggers anything in the general economy. In the 10Qs and 10Ks I\\\\u2019ve read, a high percentage of loans allowed people to make tiny payments early on, made up by higher payments later. I think this is dumb lending and dumb borrowing because someone who can only make 20-30% payments now isn\\\\u2019t going to be able to make 110% payments in the future. Those people and institutions were betting that house prices would keep going up. When this stops, you have a big supply of houses come on the market, like we saw in manufactured housing. You\\\\u2019ll see plenty of misery in that field \\\\u2013 you\\\\u2019ve already seen some. But I don\\\\u2019t think it\\\\u2019ll be any huge anchor for the economy. Munger: There\\\\u2019s been a lot of sin and folly, a lot of it due to accountants who let lenders book profits when no one in their right mind would have allowed them to book profits. If accountants lie down on the job, you see huge folly. It\\\\u2019s in the national interest to give loans to the deserving poor. But the moment you give loans to the undeserving poor or the stretched rich, you run into trouble. I don\\\\u2019t see how people did it and still shaved in the morning, because looking back at them was a face that was evil and stupid. Buffett: You\\\\u2019ve seen some very interesting figures in the past few months on people who didn\\\\u2019t even make the first or second payment. That shouldn\\\\u2019t happen. We saw this is in the manufactured-home sector. When someone only has to make a $3,000 down payment to someone who gets a $6,000 payment [the salesperson\\\\u2019s commission], then believe me, you\\\\u2019ll see a lot of bad behavior. Securitization accentuated the problem. A local banker wouldn\\\\u2019t allow this because he\\\\u2019d see what\\\\u2019s going on, but when the loans are bundled and sold by Wall Street, that discipline disappears. It will be at least a couple of years before real estate recovers. In some areas of the country, the [housing] inventory overhang is huge.

Coca-Cola earns 80% or more from their international operations; Gillette will earn two thirds or more from international operations, so we get a lot from outside the United States. It\\'s a slight advantage to us having U.S.-domiciled companies. For instance, we get better treatment on the dividends if they are domestically based because of the way the U.S. tax laws go.

The whole company was selling for $35 billion. It was selling for one-fourth of the price of Exxon, but was making profits equal to 80% of Exxon. I was reading the annual report one day and in it I saw a message from the Chairman saying that the company would pay out 45% of its profits as dividends. This was much more than any company like this, and I liked the reserves. If it were a US company, it would sell for $85 billion; it\\\\u2019s a good, solid company. I don\\\\u2019t understand the Chinese culture like I understand the US culture.

In July, the owner of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky (at that time, the richest man in Russia) had breakfast with me and was asking for my consultation if they should expand into New York and if this was too onerous considering the SEC regulations. Four months later, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was in prison. Putin put him in. He took on Putin and lost. His decision on geopolitical thinking was wrong and now the company is finished. PetroChina was the superior investment choice. 45% was a crazy amount of dividends to offer but China kept its word. I am never quite as happy as I am in the US, because the laws are more uncertain elsewhere, but the point is to buy things cheap. Russia is just a bad geopolitical environment. On the other hand, China has kept their word on paying the dividends. In fact, when the dividends check comes in, it is calculated out 10 or so decimals, these guys keep their word.

I wouldn\\'t want to get involved in currency risk, so it would have to be Yen-denominated. I would have to be in Japanese Real Estate or Japanese companies or something of the sort and all I have to do is beat one percent. That is all the money is going to cost me and I can get it for 10 years. So far I haven\\'t found anything. It is kind of interesting. The Japanese businesses earn very low returns on equity - 4% to 5% - 6% on equity and it is very hard to earn a lot as an investor when the business you are in doesn\\'t earn very much money. Now some people do it. In fact, I have a friend, Walter Schloss, who worked at Graham at the same time I did. And it was the first way I went at stocks to buy stocks selling way below working capital. A very cheap, quantitative approach to stocks. I call it the cigar butt approach to investing. You walk down the street and you look around for a cigar butt someplace. Finally you see one and it is soggy and kind of repulsive, but there is one puff left in it. So you pick it up and the puff is freeit is a cigar butt stock. You get one free puff on it and then you throw it away and try another one. It is not elegant. But it works. Those are low return businesses. But time is the friend of the wonderful business; it is the enemy of the lousy business. If you are in a lousy business for a long time, you will get a lousy result even if you buy it cheap. If you are in a wonderful business for a long time, even if you pay a little bit too much going in you will get a wonderful result if you stay in a long time. I find very few wonderful businesses in Japan at present. They may change the culture in some way so that management gets more share holder responsive over there and stock returns are higher. At the present time you will find a lot of low return businesses and that was true even when the Japanese economy was booming. It is amazing; they had an incredible market without incredible companies. They were incredible in terms of doing a lot of business, but they were not incredible in terms of the return on equity that they achieved and that has finally caught up with them.

Because of less liquidity, the off-the-run bonds were selling for 30 basis points less, which translates into 3% of principal value.

It\\\\u2019s useful to get into a business like that. When I speak to students, I ask them to name a great business. One answer is running a business school, because the amount you charge is a sign of prestige. No one wants to go to the business school that charges $20,000 in tuition, but if the school charges $40,000, more do. In the investment field, you now have large portions of investment managers that charge fees that, in aggregate, cannot work out for investors. Obviously, some [investments in high-fee managers] do [work out well]. But you can\\\\u2019t pay 2 and 20 [2% annual management fee and 20% of the profits, standard for private-equity and hedge funds], in which you pay the manager 20% of the profits if they make money and, if they don\\\\u2019t, they just close up and reopen later. If you charge this in an economy that\\\\u2019s only growing a few percent a year, the math doesn\\\\u2019t work.

I will bet you that if you name any 10 partnerships with over $500 million in assets and put them up against the S&P 500, they will trail the S&P, after fees, over time.

Some have generated 20% or greater returns on tangible equity over many years, though this is in part due to increasing leverage. [CM: \\\\\"We misdiagnosed it and, even worse than that, we haven\\'t changed.\\\\\"  Banking, if you can just stay away from following the fads and making bad loans, has been a remarkably good business. Since WW II, ROE for banks that have stayed out of trouble has been good. Some large well-run banks earn 20% ROE. I\\'ve been surprised that margins in banking haven\\'t been competed away. [CM: What you\\'re saying is that we screwed up, because banking has turned out to be better than we thought. We made a few billion [dollars] from Amex while we misappraised it. My only prediction is that we will continue to make mistakes like that.] It\\'s pretty extraordinary that institutions competing against each other without real competitive advantages can all make high returns. Part of it is higher loan to value ratios than in past years. Some banks get into trouble making bad loans, but you don\\'t have to.  Financial companies are more difficult to analyze than other companies. They can report whatever earnings they want \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s an easy game to play. For banks, earnings depend on loans and the reserves set aside. It\\\\u2019s easy to change and manipulate the reserves. With a company like WD-40 or a brick company, the financials are easy to analyze. But with financial [companies] it\\\\u2019s tough, especially when you throw in derivatives. There were very high grade, financially sophisticated people who were on the boards of the GSEs [Government-Sponsored Enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] and they were not negligent, but it\\\\u2019s very tough [to detect the shenanigans that went on]. Charlie and I were on the board of Salomon and Charlie was on the audit committee, and [it\\\\u2019s just impossible to evaluate thousands of transactions]. You\\\\u2019ll just have to accept that with insurance companies, banks and other financial companies \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s just a more dangerous field to analyze. With GEICO it\\\\u2019s easier because the statistics are quite accurate \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s short-tailed insurance. It\\\\u2019s not like asbestos. I wouldn\\\\u2019t fault the ratings agencies. Even the big-name auditors didn\\\\u2019t catch it. [CM: Where you have complexity, by nature you can have fraud and mistakes. You\\\\u2019ll have more of that than in a company that shovels sand from a river and sells it. This will always be true of financial companies, including ones run by governments. If you want accurate numbers from financial companies, you\\\\u2019re in the wrong world.]  [Q - Small regional banks - what would you look at before you buy?] WB: It is hard to make a categorical decision about regional banks. So much depends on the character of the institution. It will be a reflection of the CEO you have. A bank can mean anything. It can be an institution that is doing all sorts of crazy things. The Bank of Commonwealth was an example. We owned a bank in Rockford, Illinois, run by Dean Aback\\\\u2014he would always run a super, sound bank. You should know the culture of the management and the institution before making the decision to buy a bank. We own Wells Fargo and M&T, but it doesn\\\\u2019t mean they are immune. But likely they are immune from institutional stupidity. There was a wise man that said there are more banks than bankers. If you think about that a while, you will get my point. CM: The questioner is on to something. So many large banks have cast a pall over the entire industry. You are prospecting in a likely territory. WB: If you took the 20 largest and the 20 smallest banks in Florida, I don\\\\u2019t know if you could tell the difference. CM: It is a territory that has some promise.

How do you value the pipeline of drug companies?] WB: Unlike many businesses, when we invest in pharma, we don\\\\u2019t know the answer on the pipeline, and it\\\\u2019ll be a different pipeline 5 years from now anyway. We don\\\\u2019t know whether Pfizer or Merck, etc, have a better chance, or which of those will come out with a blockbuster. But we do feel we have a group of companies bought at a fair price that, overall, will do well and should offer chances for decent profits. These companies are doing very important things. I could not tell you the potential in the pipeline. A group approach makes sense. It is not the way we would go at banks. If you buy pharma at a reasonable multiple, you will probably do okay 5-10 years from now. CM: You now have a monopoly on our joint knowledge of pharmacology.

They\\\\u2019re not the consequences of their own doing, but they have inherited a legacy cost structure, with contracts put in place decades ago, that make it very difficult for them to be competitive in today\\\\u2019s world. GM and Ford don\\\\u2019t sign long-term contracts to pay high amounts for steel, but that\\\\u2019s what they\\\\u2019ve done with annuity and healthcare payments to employees. The result is such expenses are far higher than that of competitors, so it\\\\u2019s not a fair fight. GM once had 50% market share, and it\\\\u2019s fallen to 25%. Even if it was still 50%, they\\\\u2019d still be in trouble. I\\\\u2019m not sure what I\\\\u2019d do if I was elected CEO of GM. It reminds me of what Bill Buckley said when asked what he would do if he actually won his race for New York mayor back in 1965 and he said, \\\\u201cThe first thing I\\\\u2019d do is ask for a recount.\\\\u201d (Laughter) Well, that\\\\u2019s what I\\\\u2019d do at GM.

If a company had to pay an extra $2,000 per car more for steel, everyone would realize there was a crisis and demand a quick solution, but that\\\\u2019s not happening. Part of the problem arose because [the actions of previous managements] bore no accounting consequences. Back in the 1960s, companies didn\\\\u2019t have to account for pension costs on an accrual basis, and didn\\\\u2019t have to do so for healthcare costs until the late 80s or early 90s.

As the years have gone by, technology has produced a variety of new ways to be informed or entertained, but we still only have two eyeballs and 24 hours per day. And any time there\\\\u2019s more competition, generally that\\\\u2019s bad for business. Newspapers are still highly profitable, especially compared to tangible capital employed, but the outlook isn\\\\u2019t nearly as rosy as it was 20-30 years ago. The audience is going down and that has to erode the economics over time. People also like to talk about how more competition [is good for business, but it\\\\u2019s not true]. At one time, [the major television networks] had a license from the government and were the only three highways to the eyeballs of hundreds of millions of people for advertisers like GM, Ford and Gillette to choose from. But now there are many highways. It\\\\u2019s hard to imagine these businesses [the networks] getting better in aggregate over time. The key would have been to buy the NFL [National Football League; e.g., content] at inception. We still own World Book [encyclopedias]. At one time, we sold 300,000 sets for $600 each. The problem is [that with the advent of the Internet] you could get a good bit of the same information without cutting down tress, delivering the books, etc. The problem wasn\\\\u2019t that the product wasn\\\\u2019t worth the money, it\\\\u2019s that people have other alternatives. I don\\\\u2019t see anything that will change this. [CM: It\\\\u2019s simplicity itself that its future will be way worse than its past.] What multiple would you pay for a business earning $100 million, which is going down 5% per year, versus the same business with earnings growing 5% per year? I\\\\u2019m not saying those are the numbers I\\\\u2019d use for newspapers, by the way. I do not think newspaper circulation, or ad pages, will be larger in five years \\\\u2013 even in areas of the country that are growing [in population]. Newspaper multiples are uncomfortably high if you believe profits are going to decline. Prices today do not reflect earnings declining at 5-6% per year. There\\\\u2019s also the risk that [owners of newspaper businesses] don\\\\u2019t fully recognize the situation and will buy other newspapers at too high a price. This comes from someone who loves newspapers and couldn\\\\u2019t do without them. I read five newspapers every day. Charlie does too. But people can [do without them]. The decline, if anything, has accelerated somewhat. When they take people to the cemetery, they\\\\u2019re losing readers, but when they graduate from college, they\\\\u2019re not gaining any readers. The virtuous cycle isn\\\\u2019t true anymore, but prices don\\\\u2019t reflect this. We love them as products and thought they were the greatest of companies with bulletproof franchises. We were wrong. [CM: I have a greater sin to confess to. I once thought GM was a bulletproof franchise. But we have a method of coping: we just put it in the \\\\u201ctoo hard\\\\u201d basket. If something is too hard, we move on to something that\\\\u2019s not too hard. What could be more simple?] It used to be the easiest business model to understand. In the 1991 annual report, I wrote about [advertising] preprints, and how there was nothing magical about the newspaper, but that it brought the preprints inside the house. [I\\\\u2019m not sure what Buffett was talking about here \\\\u2013 the word \\\\u201cpreprint\\\\u201d doesn\\\\u2019t appear in the 1989-1992 annual reports, but his discussion in his 1991 letter of the declining economics of the media business is fascinating and his conclusion was amazingly prescient: \\\\u201cMost media properties continue to have far better economic characteristics than those possessed by the average American business. But gone are the days of bullet-proof franchises and cornucopian economics.\\\\u201d] It has been interesting for me to watch both direct owners and investors in the newspaper business resist seeing what\\\\u2019s right in front of them. It [newspapers\\\\u2019 superior economics] went so long the other way. You couldn\\\\u2019t make a mistake buying a monopoly newspaper business [meaning a town in which there was only one newspaper] until 1975 or 1980. [CM: If the technology hadn\\\\u2019t changed, they\\\\u2019d still be great businesses. Network TV [in its heyday,] anyone could run and do well. If Tom Murphy was running it, you\\\\u2019d do very well, but even your idiot nephew could do well. Fortunately, carbide cutting tools [such as those made by Iscar] don\\\\u2019t have these types of substitutes.] - What advice do you have for long-suffering New York Times shareholders and what do you think of its dual-class share structure? As for the \\\\u201clong suffering\\\\u201d, as you put it, shareholders of the New York Times, I don\\\\u2019t blame the Sulzbergers for what\\\\u2019s happened. [Here is the bio of Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the Chairman and Publisher of the New York Times Co., and here is a 2005 BusinessWeek article about the family, the company and the challenges they face.] We\\\\u2019ve said for a long time that we thought newspapers were overpriced because investors were looking in the rear-view mirror. As for different share classes [which the NYT has], I own about 30% of Berkshire A and B shares, so there\\\\u2019s no voting difference. The woes of the newspaper business have nothing to do with the dual-class structure. Let\\\\u2019s suppose Mr. Gutenberg [Johannes Gutenberg was the inventor of modern printing] in the 1500s [actually 1400s; he lived 1400-1468] had become a day trader or hedge fund manager instead, so that we never had printing. But along came the Internet and cable TV [as we have today]. Now imagine that someone came along saying, \\\\u201cI have a great idea: let\\\\u2019s chop trees down, buy expensive printing presses and buy a fleet of delivery trucks, all to get pieces of paper to people to read about what happened yesterday.\\\\u201d I don\\\\u2019t think we\\\\u2019d be backing him. [Buffett\\\\u2019s point is that if newspapers didn\\\\u2019t exist, no one would create them now.] It happened that newspapers came first and people have become accustomed to them. They have momentum on their side from the past, but I don\\\\u2019t care how smart you are, you\\\\u2019re not going to be able to do much to reverse their decline. Some smart guy came to the Los Angeles Times and said he was going to take circulation up to 1.5 million. Well, it\\\\u2019s now at 800,000. I don\\\\u2019t know if even William Randolph Hearst could do much to change this. The same thing happened to us with the World Book Encyclopedia \\\\u2013 its sales have dropped from 300,000 to 22,000. The companies that have not had dual-class structures have fared just as badly. For example, we own The Buffalo News, and earnings are down 40% from the peak. Despite terrific management and high market share, earnings are going down. It\\\\u2019s a fact of life. Munger: He said the dual-class structure is intrinsically wrong. It was in the original contract when the New York Times Co. went public. Stamping your foot if you don\\\\u2019t like it strikes me as immature. Buffett: Sulzberger [Arthur Sr.] would not slash staff and did not follow the typical business school approach \\\\u2013 and look at his success. All the others fell by the wayside. I don\\\\u2019t know if 10-15 years from now, the New York Times will be viewed as having played an inferior hand. The Los Angeles Times will have more trouble monetizing their reputation on the Internet when compared to the New York Times.  [Q - Would there be a compelling price at which Buffett would add another newspaper to Berkshire\\\\u2019s portfolio?] Buffett: There\\\\u2019s an evolutionary situation with newspapers. I read five a day and so does Charlie. We\\\\u2019ll be the last people reading a newspaper, with a land line by our sides. [laughter] Most newspapers in the U.S. we would not buy at any price. Twenty to forty years ago, they were essential to customers and advertisers. They had pricing power, but they\\\\u2019ve lost their essential nature\\\\u2014essentiality has eroded. Erosion accelerated dramatically, and it won\\\\u2019t end based on anything on the horizon. We do not see anything to reverse it. They are essential to advertisers only as long as they\\\\u2019re essential to readers. Ten years ago, the head of The Buffalo News said that on an economic basis, Berkshire should sell The Buffalo News. We could have sold the business for hundreds of millions. Not so today. As long as we\\\\u2019re not losing money forever and there are no union problems, we won\\\\u2019t sell. There are around 1,400 daily U.S. papers, and nobody has found the model that works. We\\\\u2019ll play it out as long as we can. Munger: One hundred percent right. Monopoly daily newspapers were impregnable. It\\\\u2019s a national tragedy for newspapers to die off. They kept government more honest than they otherwise would be. What replaces it will be less desirable.  [Q - Are you still down on newspapers? Ipad and other e-reading technologies \\\\u2013 will it end up with contraction in earnings retained by content provider or by distributor?] WB: When money at newspapers came from advertising \\\\u2013 it was on average about 75%, they used to be only game in town, and what a difference that makes, when you aren\\\\u2019t the only game in town. It is very tempting, without substantial circulation, but the math is tough \\\\u2013 printing costs are high and distribution is tough. But I don\\\\u2019t understand it, and I can\\\\u2019t make an affirmative decision. [ABC] puts out Fast Facts, I look at circulation of many papers.In Buffalo we were down less than many places. SF Chronicle was down 20%, Dallas too \\\\u2013 many people are dropping the paper. World has changed about the essential value of newspapers.Nothing looked more bullet proof than daily newspapers 40 years ago, and that has melted away. It is a form of news and entertainment that has lost its immediacy, it is not the essential place to get information. You looked for stocks and weather and sports \\\\u2013 advertisers were there because it was best and only microphone. The problem is self-reinforcing, subscribers leave and advertisers leave too. CM: Independent newspapers due to accidents of history became dominant in their towns. The world was better because they were strong, because they kept the government in check \\\\u2013 they were called the fourth estate. We are losing something that we have no substitute for. I don\\\\u2019t have the faintest idea what to do about it. WB: Our newspaper hit 300k at peak on Sunday, and now down 100k. Philadelphia, was down 40k in a single year. The advertiser doesn\\\\u2019t need you. Your ability to price evaporates. We met Lord Thompson who owned paper in Council Bluffs. We asked him, \\\\u201cHave you ever been there?\\\\u201d \\\\u201cI wouldn\\\\u2019t dream of it\\\\u201d he said. We asked, \\\\u201cYou seem to increase price every year. What can they do about it?\\\\u201d He replied \\\\u201cNothing, I tell my US managers to price to make 40% pretax and above that it may be gouging.

He also had the cigar butt analogy for buying businesses...you can usually get one good puff out of it and it\\\\u2019s free. Berkshire made a lot of money after WWII (more than Pfizer and Merck) and then it steadily went downhill. Between 1955 and 1965 Berkshire went from 12 mills to 2 mills and they bought their own stock as mills closed. We bought 100,000 shares out of 1 million in 1962 at $7 3/8 and the company had $10-11/share in working capital...I knew I wouldn\\\\u2019t lose money because of the working capital. It was losing money but it was also liquefying assets by closing mills. Seabury Stanton was running Berkshire at the time and I went to go visit him. We had an agreement that Berkshire would tender $11-1/2 for my shares of the company. At this point, I could not buy any stock as I had inside information. A few weeks later I received a letter from Old Colony Trust containing a tender offer of $11-3/8. Early the following week, Seabury tendered the stock at 11 3/8. As result, I began buying more Berkshire. Other family members of Seabury Stanton sold their shares to me and I gained controlling interest in the company. The family members weren\\\\u2019t very happy with Seabury either really. We ran the mills until 1985. See\\\\u2019s Candy is an example of low rate of return on capital expenditures individually yet the company as a whole makes loads of money because of the great brand of See\\\\u2019s. We bought See\\\\u2019s in 1972 and every year since then we have raised the prices the day after Christmas and it never hurt the business. When we invest we ask one question, how long do you have to wait to raise the prices? If you are an airline today and you try to raise your prices, an hour later, you will be lowering them because of competition. Not the case with a good brand like See\\\\u2019s. If I were to give you a $100 million, I\\\\u2019m not going to, but if I did, you could not damage the See\\\\u2019s brand in the minds of 30 or so million Californians. Only See\\\\u2019s can do that.

It will grow in the U.S. on a per capita basis. The fact that it will be a tough period for who knows\\\\u2014three months or three years\\\\u2014but it won\\\\u2019t be tough for twenty years. People will still be going to be working productively around the world and they are going to find this is a bargain product in terms of a portion of their working day that they have to give up in order to have one of these, better yet, five of them a day like I do. This is a product that in 1936 when I first bought 6 of those for a quarter and sold them for a nickel each. It was in a 6.5 oz bottle and you paid a two cents deposit on the bottle. That was a 6.5 oz. bottle for a nickel at that time; it is now a 12 oz. can which if you buy it on Weekends or if you buy it in bigger quantities, so much money doesn\\\\u2019t go to packaging\\\\u2014you essentially can buy the 12 ozs. for not much more than 20 cents. So you are paying not much more than twice the per oz. price of 1936. This is a product that has gotten cheaper and cheaper relative to people\\\\u2019s earning power over the years. And which people love. And in 200 countries, you have the per capita consumption use going up every year for a product that is over 100 years old that dominates the market. That is unbelievable. One thing that people don\\\\u2019t understand is one thing that makes this product worth 10s and 10s of billions of dollars is one simple fact about really all colas, but we will call it Coca-Cola for the moment. It happens to be a name that I like. Cola has no taste memory. You can drink one of these at 9 O\\\\u2019clock, 10 O\\\\u2019clock, 1 O\\\\u2019clock and 5 O\\\\u2019clock. The one at 5 o\\\\u2019clock will taste as good to you as the one you drank early in the morning, you can\\\\u2019t do that with Cream Soda, Root Beer, Orange, Grape. All of those things accumulate on you. Most foods and beverages accumulate; you get sick of them after a while. And if you eat See\\\\u2019s Candy\\\\u2014we get these people who go to work for us at See\\\\u2019s Candy and the first day they go crazy, but after a week they are eating the same amount as if they were buying it, because chocolate accumulates on you. There is no taste memory to Cola and that means you get people around the world who will be heavy users\\\\u2014who will drink five a day, or for Diet Coke, 7 or even 8 a day. They will never do that with other products. So you get this incredible per capita consumption. The average person in this part of the world or maybe a little north of here drinks 64 ozs. of liquid a day. You can have 64 ozs. of that be Coke and you will not get fed up with Coke if you like it to start with in the least. But if you do that with anything else; if you eat just one product all day, you will get a little sick of it after a while. It is a huge factor. So today over 1 billion of Coca-Cola product servings will be sold in the world and that will grow year by year. It will grow in every country virtually, and it will grow on a per capita basis. And twenty years from now it will grow a lot faster internationally than in the U.S., so I really like that market better, because there is more growth there over time. But it will hurt them in the short term right now, but that doesn\\\\u2019t mean anything. Coca-Cola went public in 1919; the stock sold for $40 per share. The Chandler family bought the whole business for $2,000 back in the late 1880s. So now he goes public in 1919, $40 per share. One year later it is selling for $19 per share. It has gone down 50% in one year. You might think it is some kind of disaster and you might think sugar prices increased and the bottlers were rebellious. And a whole bunch of things. You can always find reasons that weren\\'t the ideal moment to buy it. Years later you would have seen the Great Depression, WW II and sugar rationing and thermonuclear weapons and the whole thing\\\\u2014there is always a reason. But in the end if you had bought one share at $40 per share and reinvested the dividends, it would be worth $5 million now ($40 compounding at 14.63% for 86 years!). That factor so overrides anything else. If you are right about the business you will make a lot of money. The timing part of it is very tricky thing so I don\\\\u2019t worry about any given event if I got a wonderful business what it does next year or something of the sort. Price controls have been in this country at various times and that has fouled up even the best of businesses. I wouldn\\\\u2019t be able to raise prices Dec31st on See\\\\u2019s Candy.But that doesn\\\\u2019t make it a lousy business if that happens to happen, because you are not going to have price controls forever. We had price controls in the early 70s. The wonderful business\\\\u2014you can figure what will happen, you can\\\\u2019t figure out when it will happen. You don\\\\u2019t want to focus too much on when but you want to focus on what. If you are right about what, you don\\\\u2019t have to worry about when very much. - Coca-Cola is a fabulous company. It will sell over 21 billion cases [of all of its products] around the world and that goes up every year. It\\\\u2019s a really wonderful business that sold at a silly price a few years ago. The stock sold at $80 [in the late 1990s] when earnings were $1.50. Earnings are higher quality today [at $2.18 per share in 2005, while the stock trades around $43]. Every year, Coke accounts for a little greater percentage of the liquids consumed in the world. It has $5-6 billion of tangible assets and makes a similar amount of pre-tax earnings. There are not a lot of big businesses that earn 100% returns on tangible assets. The stock was ridiculously overvalued, but you can\\\\u2019t blame [CEO Neville] Isdell today for that. You can fault me for not selling at 50x earnings.

It\\\\u2019s very similar to big oil companies elsewhere in the world.  It\\\\u2019s the 4th most profitable oil company in the world \\\\u2013 it produces as much crude as Exxon.  It\\\\u2019s not complicated \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s a big integrated oil company, so it\\\\u2019s fairly easy to get your mind around the economics of the business. The annual report will tell you more about the business than [the annual reports of] other oil giants.  They tell you they\\\\u2019ll pay out 45% of their earnings, barring the unexpected.  I like knowing that that cash will come to Berkshire. It was bought because it was very, very cheap by any metric \\\\u2013 far cheaper than Exxon, BP, Shell...  You could say it should be cheaper, given that it\\\\u2019s 90% owned by the government of China, which is a factor, yes, but not so big for me.  If you read the annual report of PetroChina, you\\\\u2019ll have as good an understanding of the company as reading the annual report any other oil company.  Then, you can think about risks such as a disruption of US-China relations. [CM: I think if it\\\\u2019s cheap enough, you can afford more country risk or regulatory risk.  It\\\\u2019s not complicated.] There\\\\u2019s Yukos, the big oil company in Russia.  In evaluating country risk, you can reach your own judgments.  In our view, PetroChina had less risk. [Later in the meeting, Buffett and Munger returned to the discussion of this company:] You don\\\\u2019t need any blinding insights to invest in PetroChina.  They\\\\u2019re producing 2.5% of the world\\\\u2019s oil, it\\\\u2019s priced in US dollars, they control a significant part of the refining in China, and they pay out 45% of their earnings in dividends.  If you\\\\u2019re buying something like that at 1/3 the valuation of comparable companies, it\\\\u2019s not hard.  You just have to do the work. [CM: But when you were buying, no-one else was. It required uncommon sense.] - We bought it a few years ago, investing $400 million. It was my first investment in a Chinese stock. I read the annual report. They produce 3% of the world\\\\u2019s oil, about 80% as much as Exxon Mobil. Last year, it earned $12 billion in profit \\\\u2013 only maybe five US companies earned as much last year. The total market value when I bought it was around $35 billion, so I paid only three times last year\\\\u2019s earnings. The company does not have unusually large amounts of leverage and \\\\u2013 this is unusual \\\\u2013 has a stated policy of paying out 45% of its earnings in cash, so that\\\\u2019s a 15% cash yield [based on last year\\\\u2019s earnings, since Berkshire bought it at 3x those earnings]. The Chinese government owns 90% and we own 1.3%, so if we vote with them, together we control the business. (Laughter) Unfortunately, we don\\\\u2019t own the same shares [as the Chinese government]. [We own another class of shares such that] we had to report our interest [in the company] at 1.3%. We would have liked to buy more, but the price jumped up [after our ownership stake was disclosed]. [CM: It would be nice if this [finding really cheap stocks] happened all the time. Unfortunately, it doesn\\\\u2019t.] I simply read the annual report. I had no contact with management nor did I attend any management presentations. I just sat in my office and invested $400 million, which is worth $1.2 billion today. I also looked at Yukos, the big Russian oil company [at the time I bought PetroChina] and compared the two at the time. PetroChina was far cheaper and I thought the economic climate was likely to be better in China. Yes, there was risk of tax laws or ownership rights changing, but the price was ridiculous. - [Q - In 2002, you invested in PetroChina and all you did was read the annual report. Most professional investors have more resources at hand. Wouldn\\\\u2019t you want to do more research? What do you look for in an annual like that? How could you make the investment only on a report?] WB: I read it in the spring of 2002, and I never asked anyone else their opinion. I thought it was worth $100 billion after reading the report. I then checked the price, and it was selling for $35 billion. What is the sense of talking to management? It doesn\\\\u2019t make any difference. If the market value was $40 billion, you would need to refine the analysis. We don\\\\u2019t like things you have to carry out to 3 decimal places. If someone weighed somewhere between 300-350 pounds, I wouldn\\\\u2019t need precision \\\\u2014 I would know they were fat. If you can\\\\u2019t make a decision on PetroChina off the figures, you go on to the next one. You weren\\\\u2019t going to learn more if you thought their big [oil] field was going to decline out slightly faster, etc. CM: We have lower due diligence expenses than anyone in America. I know of a place that pays over $200 million to its accountants every year, and I know we are safer because we think like engineers \\\\u2014 we want margins of reliability. It is a very dicey process. WB: If you think the auditors know more about an acquisition, then they should run the business and you should take up auditing. When we got the call on Mars-Wrigley I wasn\\\\u2019t going to look at labor costs or leases. The value of Wrigley does not depend on the value of the lease or an environmental problem. There is a whole lot of trivia that doesn\\\\u2019t mean anything. I never made an investment that would have been avoided due to conventional due diligence. We would have lost deals. On big deals, people rely more and more on process. When people want a deal, they will come to us. Mars only wanted to deal with Berkshire \\\\u2014 there were no lawyers involved and no Directors involved. I got a call, it made sense, and I said yes. There was no material adverse change clause. Our $6.5 billion will be available regardless, even if Ben Bernanke runs off to South America with Paris Hilton. [eruption of laughter] That assurance is worth something. If you say, \\\\u2018I\\\\u2019ll do it, but I need X, Y, Z, etc.\\\\u2019\\\\u2014 that is costly. [Q - I\\\\u2019m here with a group of Chinese executives. We came here to see how companies should be run. You did a quick trade on PetroChina. What comes to your mind when selling? Any suggestions for these Chinese executives?] WB: I met Dr. Gao recently from the China Investment Corp. for lunch. I was very impressed with him. We had lunch in Omaha. PetroChina was a $35 billion company when we bought [and I thought it was worth $100 billion]. When oil was at $70-75 per barrel, the analysis was the same but I then thought it was worth about $275-300 billion. That is about where it was then trading, so we sold. It went up significantly after- wards because of the A-share listing, and at one point, it became the most valuable company in the world by market cap. They\\\\u2019ve done a terrific job. If it went to a significant discount, we would buy again. I\\\\u2019m not so sure we don\\\\u2019t have a lot to learn from China vs. what we have to teach. China has a remarkable society. I traveled 45 minutes outside of Dalian, and saw hundreds of plants that were developed in recent years. The Chinese are starting to realize their potential. There is lots of ability, but the system did not realize its potential. I think it will continue to get better. I would look for the best practices and I would discard the rest. If you look at effective individuals\\\\u2014why do people want to be around them? You should copy those qualities. I would look for what I admire and emulate it, and try not to let distasteful things be copied.

[Buffett had prepared slides and had them put up on the screens in the convention center.  Slide 1 showed Berkshire Hathaway\\\\u2019s balance sheet shortly before it bought National Indemnity.] For 15 minutes each year, Jack Greenwald [the owner of National Indemnity] would get frustrated with something and want to sell his company.  I told Charlie that the next time he was in heat, bring him to me.  So, we bought it in \\\\u201967 for $7 million. [Slide 2 showed premium volume for National Indemnity from 1980 through 2003.  It was $80 million in 1980, rose to $366 million in 1986, then declined nearly every year down to $54 million in 1999, and then spiked up to $595 million in 2003.  Buffett highlighted the decline from 1986 to 1999 and asked:] How many public companies in America would see premiums go down every year for such an extended period? [Slide 3 showed the number of employees at National Indemnity from 1980-2003.  The number rose from 1980-86 and then declined from 1986-99, but much more slowly than premiums declined.  Buffett noted:] We never fired anyone \\\\u2013 the decline in headcount was solely due to retirements.  The key is you can\\\\u2019t fire people if they don\\\\u2019t write business, or they\\\\u2019ll write business.  You must be able to tell them that if they write no business, their job is not in jeopardy. [Slide 4 showed National Indemnity\\\\u2019s expense ratio from 1980-2003, which was as low as 25.9% in a peak year, and as high as 41% in the worst year, 1999.  Buffett noted that:] Some companies would feel that this is unacceptable.  [We don\\\\u2019t.]  We can take an expense ratio that\\\\u2019s out of line, but can\\\\u2019t take writing bad business. [Slide 5 showed the combined ratio at National Indemnity from 1980-2003.  The combined ratio exceed 100 during a few bad years for the industry in the early 1980s, which is what led to the hard market that peaked in 1986, but National Indemnity\\\\u2019s combined ratio has been below 100 \\\\u2013 e.g., the business has been profitable \\\\u2013 in every year for the past 20.  Buffett pointed out:] In 1986, our combined ratio was only 69.3 because we did the most volume ever that year, up to that point [the company has done more volume in the past few years].  We coined money when we wrote a lot of business, and made a little when we didn\\\\u2019t.  We\\\\u2019re the only company like this.  We\\\\u2019ll have a high expense ratio when business is slow. National Indemnity was a no-name company when we bought it, and has no copyrights, patents, etc. to distinguish it, but they have a record like no-one else because they had discipline. You can\\\\u2019t run an auto or steel company this way, but it\\\\u2019s the best way to run an insurance company. [CM: Nobody else does it, but to me it\\\\u2019s obviously the only way to go.  A lot about Berkshire is like this.  Being controlling owners is key \\\\u2013 it would be hard for a committee to make these kinds of decisions.]\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Reasoning behind the HomeServices investment?\", \"answer\": \"HomeServices will grow.

[In response to another question about whether the internet will threaten the commission structure of real estate brokers like HomeServices, Buffett replied:] I think commissions in HomeServices are sustainable.  Barry Diller is interested in the space via Lending Tree, and the internet is a threat to any business, including real estate brokerage.  But when I think about the process of owning a home, the for-sale-by-owner (FSBO) was with us 50 years ago and it is now [but it hasn\\\\u2019t affected commissions].  My guess is that 30 years from now, a very significant percentage of home sales will be done through the brokerage system like today\\\\u2019s, though there are people trying to change it. [CM: [speaking to Buffett]: You tried to change it dramatically in Omaha, and you fell on your ass.  [Chuckling.]  You tried to take home listing business from the Omaha World Herald with your little paper and failed.] - We don\\\\u2019t think the way homes are bought and sold will change very much.Some will disagree, but we don\\\\u2019t think the internet will change this. [Buying and selling a home] is the biggest financial decision most people will make] and people will continue to want to have a 1-on-1 relationship with a real estate broker.

(and thoughts on low cost producers)\", \"answer\": \"The idea of direct marketing in auto insurance at GEICO came from Leo Goodwin and his wife.  They came from USAA, which was established because US military personnel moved around a lot and had trouble getting insurance.  Leo took this idea and broadened it beyond military officers.  It\\\\u2019s a better system. Going back 100 years, auto insurance was sold by casualty companies via a system of agents that charged large commissions.  It was a cartel.  State Farm was formed in the 1920s and had the idea of a captive agency force, which brought down costs.  It became the largest auto insurer, and Allstate because #2 following the same model.  This was a better system. Leo bypassed the agents and brought down costs even further. Every American family has to buy auto insurance.  It\\\\u2019s not a luxury item, so cost is key and the low cost is going to win.  The direct sellers, GEICO and Progressive, will slug it out and will win.  GEICO has a tough competitor in Progressive \\\\u2013 they\\\\u2019ve seen how we\\\\u2019ve done it [the direct model] and are moving to it. Dell is very efficient.  I\\\\u2019d hate to compete with them.  If they turn out a decent competitive product at a good price, that system will win. Charlie is on the board of Costco.  Costco and Wal-Mart have figured out how to do this [be ultra-low-cost] and they\\\\u2019re winning. It\\\\u2019s always a good idea to go with the low-cost producer over time.  Being the low-cost producer of something that people need is a good business. - Right after yearend, we completed the purchase of 100% of GEICO, the seventh largest auto insurer in the United States, with about 3.7 million cars insured. I\\\\u2019ve had a 45-year association with GEICO, and though the story has been told before, it\\\\u2019s worth a short recap here. I attended Columbia University\\\\u2019s business school in 1950-51, not because I cared about the degree it offered, but because I wanted to study under Ben Graham, then teaching there. The time I spent in Ben\\\\u2019s classes was a personal high, and quickly induced me to learn all I could about my hero. I turned first to Who\\\\u2019s Who in America, finding there, among other things, that Ben was Chairman of Government Employees Insurance Company, to me an unknown company in an unfamiliar industry. A librarian next referred me to Best\\\\u2019s Fire and Casualty insurance manual, where I learned that GEICO was based in Washington, DC. So on a Saturday in January, 1951, I took the train to Washington and headed for GEICO\\\\u2019s downtown headquarters. To my dismay, the building was closed, but I pounded on the door until a custodian appeared. I asked this puzzled fellow if there was anyone in the office I could talk to, and he said he\\\\u2019d seen one man working on the sixth floor. And thus I met Lorimer Davidson, Assistant to the President, who was later to become CEO. Though my only credentials were that I was a student of Graham\\\\u2019s, \\\\u201cDavy\\\\u201d graciously spent four hours or so showering me with both kindness and instruction. No one has ever received a better half-day course in how the insurance industry functions nor in the factors that enable one company to excel over others. As Davy made clear, GEICO\\\\u2019s method of selling \\\\u2013 direct marketing \\\\u2013 gave it an enormous cost advantage over competitors that sold through agents, a form of distribution so ingrained in the business of these insurers that it was impossible for them to give it up. After my session with Davy, I was more excited about GEICO than I have ever been about a stock. When I finished at Columbia some months later and returned to Omaha to sell securities, I naturally focused almost exclusively on GEICO. My first sales call \\\\u2013 on my Aunt Alice, who always supported me 100% \\\\u2013 was successful. But I was then a skinny, unpolished 20-year-old who looked about 17, and my pitch usually failed. Undaunted, I wrote a short report late in 1951 about GEICO for \\\\u201cThe Security I Like Best\\\\u201d column in The Commercial and Financial Chronicle, a leading financial publication of the time. More important, I bought stock for my own account. You may think this odd, but I have kept copies of every tax return I filed, starting with the return for 1944. Checking back, I find that I purchased GEICO shares on four occasions during 1951, the last purchase being made on September 26. This pattern of persistence suggests to me that my tendency toward self-intoxication was developed early. I probably came back on that September day from unsuccessfully trying to sell some prospect and decided \\\\u2013 despite my already having more than 50% of my net worth in GEICO \\\\u2013 to load up further. In any event, I accumulated 350 shares of GEICO during the year, at a cost of $10,282. At yearend, this holding was worth $13,125, more than 65% of my net worth. You can see why GEICO was my first business love. Furthermore, just to complete this stroll down memory lane, I should add that I earned most of the funds I used to buy GEICO shares by delivering The Washington Post, the chief product of a company that much later made it possible for Berkshire to turn $10 million into $500 million. Alas, I sold my entire GEICO position in 1952 for $15,259, primarily to switch into Western Insurance Securities. This act of infidelity can partially be excused by the fact that Western was selling for slightly more than one times its current earnings, a p/e ratio that for some reason caught my eye. But in the next 20 years, the GEICO stock I sold grew in value to about $1.3 million, which taught me a lesson about the inadvisability of selling a stake in an identifiably-wonderful company. In the early 1970\\\\u2019s, after Davy retired, the executives running GEICO made some serious errors in estimating their claims costs, a mistake that led the company to underprice its policies \\\\u2013 and that almost caused it to go bankrupt. The company was saved only because Jack Byrne came in as CEO in 1976 and took drastic remedial measures. Because I believed both in Jack and in GEICO\\\\u2019s fundamental competitive strength, Berkshire purchased a large interest in the company during the second half of 1976, and also made smaller purchases later. By yearend 1980, we had put $45.7 million into GEICO and owned 33.3% of its shares. During the next 15 years, we did not make further purchases. Our interest in the company, nonetheless, grew to about 50% because it was a big repurchaser of its own shares. Then, in 1995, we agreed to pay $2.3 billion for the half of the company we didn\\\\u2019t own. That is a steep price. But it gives us full ownership of a growing enterprise whose business remains exceptional for precisely the same reasons that prevailed in 1951. In addition, GEICO has two extraordinary managers: Tony Nicely, who runs the insurance side of the operation, and Lou Simpson, who runs investments. Tony, 52, has been with GEICO for 34 years. There\\\\u2019s no one I would rather have managing GEICO\\\\u2019s insurance operation. He has brains, energy, integrity and focus. If we\\\\u2019re lucky, he\\\\u2019ll stay another 34 years. Lou runs investments just as ably. Between 1980 and 1995, the equities under Lou\\\\u2019s management returned an average of 22.8% annually vs. 15.7% for the S&P. Lou takes the same conservative, concentrated approach to investments that we do at Berkshire, and it is an enormous plus for us to have him on board. One point that goes beyond Lou\\\\u2019s GEICO work: His presence on the scene assures us that Berkshire would have an extraordinary professional immediately available to handle its investments if something were to happen to Charlie and me. GEICO, of course, must continue both to attract good policyholders and keep them happy. It must also reserve and price properly. But the ultimate key to the company\\\\u2019s success is its rock-bottom operating costs, which virtually no competitor can match. In 1995, moreover, Tony and his management team pushed underwriting and loss adjustment expenses down further to 23.6% of premiums, nearly one percentage point below 1994\\\\u2019s ratio. In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable \\\\u201cmoats.\\\\u201d Thanks to Tony and his management team, GEICO\\\\u2019s moat widened in 1995. Finally, let me bring you up to date on Davy. He\\\\u2019s now 93 and remains my friend and teacher. He continues to pay close attention to GEICO and has always been there when the company\\\\u2019s CEOs \\\\u2013 Jack Byrne, Bill Snyder and Tony \\\\u2013 have needed him. Our acquisition of 100% of GEICO caused Davy to incur a large tax. Characteristically, he still warmly supported the transaction. Davy has been one of my heroes for the 45 years I\\\\u2019ve known him, and he\\\\u2019s never let me down. You should understand that Berkshire would not be where it is today if Davy had not been so generous with his time on a cold Saturday in 1951. I\\\\u2019ve often thanked him privately, but it is fitting that I use this report to thank him on behalf of Berkshire\\\\u2019s shareholders.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Reasoning behind the Iscar acquisition?\", \"answer\": \"We acquired a large, extremely well managed company called Iscar.

And Berkshire is run by young people who we\\\\u2019d like to work with for 20-25 years. [Laughter] We had a very interesting lesson from Warren and then Charlie \\\\u2013 and we survived! [More laughter] I represent a big family. We make cutting tools and molds for cars, washing machines, the mold for Coke bottles, etc. I want to thank our customers, not only for buying from us but for trying new things.

We\\\\u2019re in 61 countries around the world. We have to fulfill a lot of expectations and work very hard to make sure everyone in this room is glad that we joined the family. Let\\\\u2019s be successful and look to the future. Every year, I look forward to coming to Omaha when the fields are green and the days get longer. [At this point, on the main screen, there was a 10-15 minute movie about Iscar and its many worldwide subsidiaries, products and markets. The company makes all kinds of highly specialized cutting tools that are used in a wide range of industries, including automobiles and aerospace. The movie also touched on the history of the company, which was founded in the mid-1950s by Stef Wertheimer, Eitan\\\\u2019s father, who is currently honorary Chairman.] This is an important acquisition. We paid $4 billion for 80% of the company. It\\\\u2019s the first business we\\\\u2019ve purchased that is based outside the U.S., though many we\\\\u2019ve purchased have major operations outside the U.S. I think you\\\\u2019ll look back at this in 5 to 10 years as a very significant event in Berkshire\\\\u2019s history. [This was, in effect, a very public wedding: both sides making vows of lifelong love, loyalty and commitment, in front of a vast number of friends, family and witnesses. In addition, the press in Israel has been remarkable. Here\\\\u2019s an excerpt from one article: Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called Eitan Wertheimer last night to congratulate him on the sale. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s terrific tidings and a great gift to the State of Israel,\\\\u201d Olmert said. \\\\u201cWe tip our hat to you, personally and in the name of the whole country.\\\\u201d Eitan Wertheimer said selling the company for him is \\\\u201clighting an economic torch,\\\\u201d just as his father Stef lit a torch on Independence Day. According to him, Buffett\\\\u2019s expression of faith is an important declaration for the country, \\\\u201cand just as they talked about the Balfour Declaration \\\\u2013 now they\\\\u2019ll talk about the Buffett Declaration.\\\\u201d Olmert will speak with Buffett today. A government source said Olmert was indirectly involved in the deal. A friend observed this and (correctly) commented: The huge edge Buffett has built is represented in the phenomenal global celebration of the Iscar acquisition.

They were incredibly impressed. Munger commented: \\\\u201cIt was a great experience. I have never seen anything as automated as that Iscar operation. I think they view it as a disgrace if any human hand has to do anything.\\\\u201d] - [Q - Chinese tungsten prices are going up \\\\u2014 will this have an impact on Iscar\\\\u2019s machine tool production?] WB: The reason the Iscar plant was built in China was to serve China. It\\\\u2019s growing. It\\\\u2019s nice to be near a raw material, but the geographic plant decision has nothing to do with changes in the price of the product. If you are creating a higher value-added product like Iscar, there may be a three-to-six-month adjustment to raw material prices, but there won\\\\u2019t be substitutes for tungsten as a raw material for cutting tools in the near term. Raw materials do get passed through. In the carpet business, oil-based raw materials are having more trouble passing costs. Over time it will pass through. But we\\\\u2019d be having trouble in that anyway. This candy will reflect sugar and cocoa over time. You can have squeezes here and there, but it\\\\u2019s not a big deal. When I visited the facility in Dalian, I had very high expectations for Iscar and they\\\\u2019ve been exceeded in every way; both financial and human expectations.

We have top service, the only worldwide service and the only service with larger planes. I thought we\\\\u2019d have economies of scale, but if anything we\\\\u2019ve had diseconomies of scale. I could give you reasons, but Rich Santulli knows the business and is addressing it. He works 16 hours a day. There is no one I have greater confidence in to fix this business. High fuel costs are a pass-through but affect the business. I think it\\\\u2019ll be profitable before long, but I\\\\u2019ve been wrong so far. We have a good business. Nearly everyone who wants a large plane comes to us. We are able to get full price, but expenses got out of control last year. You can hold me accountable for paying a lot of money for the business a number of years ago and we haven\\\\u2019t made any money yet. I looked at Raytheon\\\\u2019s annual report and they lost a lot of money in this area, but they\\\\u2019re selling their own planes so maybe they don\\\\u2019t care. [CM: The product integrity is so extreme between NetJets [and its competition]. For example, NetJets\\\\u2019 pilots are subjected to real oxygen withdrawal so they\\\\u2019ll recognize the symptoms. Not everybody does that because it\\\\u2019s expensive. They\\\\u2019re obsessive about product integrity. My guess is that this will be rewarded eventually.  [Q - What errors were committed? What was learned and how do you prevent it from happening again?] Buffett: I probably won\\'t. Mistakes will be made over time. Sometimes situations are extraordinary. We were buying at fictitious plane prices that were based on how much people thought they could be sold for vs. what we would later sell them for. In the end they were not prepared for what was obviously happening and we had to write down a lot of the planes. They also let operating costs get out of line with revenues. Remember that I stayed in the textiles business for 20 years before I finally woke up. Charlie was telling me it was lousy in year one. It was a big mistake. NetJets last year posted a $711m loss. It is now operating with a decent pretax profit, with well over $50m pretax profit in Q1 and not with any boom in plane sales. They have a new business plan that has no diminution of service or safety but is now more in line with revenues. David Sokol turned the place around like no one could have. Munger: Yes, but I believe the episode should be reviewed in context. If we buy 30 businesses and let the managers run them without interference, where 95% of the time it works well, then it is not a bad failure record. So, they will not change the management approach at all. They will continue to trust people to manage their own companies. This is how it has worked for years.

Wal-Mart announced that the price for the two deals it did  one was a small trucking company  was $1.5 billion. [It\\'s been reported that the purchase price McLane was $1.45 billion.] McLane is a wholesaler to convenience stores, quick-serve restaurants, Wal-Mart, movie theaters and so forth. It will have about $22 billion in revenues this year. Wal-Mart had owned it since 1990 and it grew substantially while they owned it. It is run by a terrific manager, Grady Rosier, and under his leadership, it grew from $3 billion to $22 billion. Wal-Mart, for very good reasons, wants to specialize on what they do extremely well. We were approached by Goldman Sachs to buy the business a week ago. It makes sense for both sides. It was a sideline business for Wal-Mart. Their ownership of McLane resulted in certain people who would be logical customers not to do business with McLane because they didn\\'t want to do business with a competitor. We\\'ll be seeing them soon to explain that they can sleep well at night buying from us. A representative of Wal-Mart, the CFO, came up to Omaha last Thursday. In one hour, we had a deal and shook hands, and when you shake hands with Wal-Mart, the deal is done. There needs to be regulatory review, but we fully expect that in just a few weeks, McLane will become part of Berkshire. It serves presently 36,000 of the 125,000 convenience stores in the United States, and has 58% share among the largest chains. To each store, it sells about $300,000 of products/year. McLane also serves 18,000 quick-serve restaurants, mainly those operated by YUM Brands (Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC). It\\'s a tough business. You have Hershey and Mars on one side and 7-11 Eleven on the other side, so you have to work hard to earn 1% pretax. [Tilson - If McLane earns 1% pre-tax on $22 billion in sales, that\\'s $220 million, so Buffett may have bought this business for 6.6x pre-tax earnings. I think this is a good price, especially if the business can grow substantially under Berkshire, but not a steal  the guys at Wal-Mart aren\\'t fools. But I think they let it go for a below-market price to Buffett because their biggest concern is that the business continue to be a reliable supplier to their stores. Such a low-margin business has little room for error, and it could get into trouble (as other similar companies have) under the ownership of a financial buyer that used too much leverage or tried to tinker with its operations.]\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"How did the Clayton Homes purchase come about?\", \"answer\": \"Clayton Homes is the class of the manufactured home industry. The deal came about in an unusual way. Every year, a class (about 40 students) from the University of Tennessee comes to Omaha. They visit some sights and then we a have classroom session for a couple of hours. Afterward, they typically give me a football or basketball. Last year, Bill Gates happened to be in town. This year, we had a good session and when they got through, they gave me a book, the autobiography of Jim Clayton, the founder of Clayton Homes. He\\'d written a nice inscription. I said to the students that I was an admirer of Jim\\'s. I read the book and called Kevin Clayton, Jim\\'s son, and said how much I\\'d enjoyed his dad\\'s book. I said if they ever decided to do anything [regarding selling the company], we\\'d be interested and I told him what price I\\'d be willing to pay. A few phone calls later, we had a deal. That\\'s the way things tend to happen at Berkshire. The manufactured home industry got in a lot of trouble. They\\'d gone crazy with credit and when you go crazy with credit, you get into a lot of trouble. Look at Conseco and Oakwood, which went into bankruptcy. The industry lost the ability to securitize receivables and was in the tank. There were 160,000 new manufactured homes this year, but there were 90,000 repossessions, so this hurts demand. For the strong, like Clayton, especially with a backer like Berkshire, it should be a good time in the industry. And it\\'s a big industry  about 20% of new homes are manufactured. We can put you in one for $30/square foot. Compare the prices  that\\'s a deal. Competitors admit that Clayton is the class of the field, but even for Clayton, financing was hard. The lenders had gotten burned. Clayton did a securitization earlier this year, but [to get the deal done, they] had to keep more of the risk on their books [Later in the meeting, in response to a question, Buffett commented further on Clayton Homes:] In the manufactured housing industry, everyone is losing money, but Clayton is making money. Most of Clayton\\'s houses are sold through 297 outlets that they own. Managers are in a 50/50 profit split with Clayton. This is unlike what was going on in the industry a few years ago, whereby dealers would have a floor plan and the [manufactured housing] company would finance 130% of the purchase price, so the dealer would bring in any warm body. The system was designed for disaster. At Clayton, if a dealer takes in an inadequate down payments, it\\'s his problem and he has to take care of repossessing it. This creates the right incentives. If you read Jim Clayton\\'s book [First A Dream], he tells about the first home he sold [when working for someone else] and all of the funny business and gaming of the financing. These activities are coming home to roost in a huge way among the manufacturers and those who financed them. There\\'s such a stain that Clayton is only one that can securitize, and without us, not to the extent they wanted. They are a class player and have the right systems in place with the right incentives. We will not securitize  we will keep it for the portfolio. You\\'re right [he was speaking to the questioner] that if you see companies with lots of gains on sales, be suspicious. - [The manufactured-home industry has] an interesting history. There have been years in which manufactured housing accounted for 20% of the new housing stock built in this country, but it\\\\u2019s now at the lowest level it\\\\u2019s been in 40 years. It\\\\u2019s fallen to 6-7% of new housing starts in the past few years, despite considerably better quality \\\\u2013 you can look at the two [Clayton Homes] houses on the exhibition floor [of the Qwest Center]. They cost only $45 per square foot. That\\\\u2019s good value. There\\\\u2019s been resistance by local builders to manufactured housing, but we\\\\u2019ve made progress. They\\\\u2019re now building subdivisions [for manufactured housing]. [For quite some time until the crash in this industry a few years ago,] the houses were mis-sold. The retailers were selling the houses to people who shouldn\\\\u2019t have been buying them, getting the down payment, and then taking the loans and selling them to some insurance company who lost a lot of money. [The subsequent crash] created a hangover that\\\\u2019s still being worked through. [Mortgages on manufactured homes] should be financed on shorter terms. Terms of 30 years are a mistake. The terms got very lax and we\\\\u2019re bearing the consequences. Somewhere down the road there will be 200,000 units [of manufactured housing sold], but not in the next year or two. The number of competitors is down. Clayton\\\\u2019s record is so much better than anyone else\\\\u2019s that you have to look hard for the #2 player. Clayton may become biggest homebuilder in the U.S. [CM: I think [the quality of] manufactured housing will continue to get a lot better and these types of homes will take more of the market.

In the case of Anheuser- Busch, I bought 100 shares 25 years ago so that I would get the annual reports (you get the annual reports a little quicker if you own the stock in your own name). So, I\\\\u2019ve been reading the company\\\\u2019s annual reports for 25 years. Recently, beer sales have been flat. Wine and spirits are growing, at the expense of beer, and Miller has been rejuvenated to some degree. So, Anheuser-Busch has been experiencing very flat earnings; they\\\\u2019ve had to spend more to maintain share and even do a bit of promotional pricing. They are going through a period that is certainly less fun for them than was the case a few years ago. It\\\\u2019s been a fascinating industry over the past 50 years. Omaha used to be a brewing town and Storz beer had 50% of the local market, but then the national brands took over. Anheuser-Busch will have a strong position for a long time. The beer business is not going to grow significantly in the U.S., but worldwide beer is popular in a great many places, and Anheuser-Busch has a very strong position. I would not expect the earnings to do much for some time, but that\\\\u2019s fine with us. [CM: In our situation, it\\\\u2019s rare that we can buy into a good company \\\\u2013 we almost need a little unpleasantness.] That\\\\u2019s true for Berkshire too. In beer, you don\\\\u2019t see the rise of generic brands, as we\\\\u2019ve seen in so many other categories. But beer consumption per capita is going nowhere. Americans drink about 64 ounces of liquid per day. 27% of that is soda (11 ounces are Coke products), beer is about 10% and, despite the rise of Starbucks, a fine company, coffee has gone down and down over time. [CM: There used to be hundreds of brewers. I think the trend toward giant companies [dominating the beer industry] is permanent.] Schlitz used to be the #1 brand of beer. There\\\\u2019s a great book on the history of the beer industry [he didn\\\\u2019t give the title, though mentioned it was written by a Wall Street Journal reporter.

Shortly thereafter, he came to visit me at 9am and by 10:30 we had a deal. I haven\\'t seen him since. The company has $300 million in revenues, earns $50 million in pre-tax profits, ties up no capital, is growing slowly, and distributes every dime of profit. There are about 18,000 picture framing shops in the United States, mostly very small businesses with a few hundred thousand dollars per year in sales. They can\\'t afford to have much inventory, so they show a catalogue to a customer who chooses the frame. Then, if they call Larson-Juhl before 3pm, 85% of the time the frame will be there the next day. Larson-Juhl and its customers are focused on service, not price. Larson-Juhl calls on its 18,000 customers an average of five times/year. It has an incredible distribution system. Tell me how you\\'d attack that business?

(2003)\", \"answer\": \"I have a lot of respect for Frank Raines [the CEO of Fannie Mae]. I think he\\'s done a good job at Fannie Mae. The problem with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the S&Ls in the past  they have a terrible problem of matching assets and liabilities. The problem is the optionality of mortgage interest. You have a 30-year instrument [e.g., a fixed-rate home mortgage] if you [the homeowner] have a good deal and a 30-minute deal if it\\'s a bad one [e.g., interest rates fall further]. The public has been educated and will refinance. It\\'s a big problem when you are operating on borrowed money in a very big way. If you run an institution that is highly leveraged, you\\'ll look for one way or another to try to match liabilities as close as you can with the duration of assets. And you try to deal with the optionality of your counterparty. It\\'s not easy to do. Fannie and Freddie try to mitigate this risk through various ways, and do a good job  probably better than we could. But it\\'s not perfect. I\\'d try to reduce this optionality and would be careful of counterparty risk. The things that really destroy people are 5- or 6-sigma events  things that really aren\\'t supposed to happen. Financial markets don\\'t do every well at modeling this. It works until it doesn\\'t. There are more theoretical 6-sigma events than any theory of probabilities will come up with. When you have gaps, markets close, etc., this is what causes companies to go out of business. Derivatives increase the chance of this happening and magnify the damage if it does. If anyone uses precise figures in finance, be careful. When Long-Term Capital Management had trouble with one type of asset, they had troubles with other types of assets  and everyone else did too. The Fed stepped in  something they never dreamed they would have to do  because it threatened stability of the US financial system. [CM: I agree with [Warren\\'s points about] counterparty risk. I think Fannie and Freddie have been thinking about a lot of scenarios where they\\'ll be okay if the counterparties pay. But I\\'ll bet they weigh the risk of counterparties not paying a lot lower than I would.] I\\'ll bet Fannie and Freddie are handling this better than their counterparties, such as the financial guarantors.

They became all about leverage \\\\u2013 they could access capital at a low rate and built a huge carry trade [borrow at low short-term rates and lend at higher long-term rates]. Then they got carried away when they promised high rates of steady growth. It was madness \\\\u2013 you can\\\\u2019t do that. If you lend for 30 years to someone who can repay in 30 seconds, as a practical matter you can\\\\u2019t perfectly handle that risk.

And I had a lot of money around and it looked to me like we would never get to do anything, so I took an attractive security form in a business I would never buy the common stock of. I went in because of that and I think generally it is a mistake. It worked out OK finally on that. But it is not what I should have been doing. I either should have waited in which case I could have bought more Coca-Cola a year later or thereabouts or I should have even bought Coke at the prices it was selling at even though it was selling at a pretty good price at the time. So that was a mistake. On Long-Term Capital that is\\\\u2014we have owned other businesses associated with securities over the years-\\\\u2013One of them is arbitrage. I\\\\u2019ve done arbitrage for 45 years and Graham did it for 30 years before that. That is a business unfortunately I have to be near a phone for.

We might lose money on something on that, but the odds are with us. That is a game that I understand. There are few other positions we have that are not that big because they can\\\\u2019t get that big. But they could involve yield curve relationships or on the run/off the run governments that are just things you learn over time being around securities markets. They are not the base of our business. Probably on average, they have accounted for 1\\\\u20442 - 3\\\\u20444 a percentage point of our return a year. They are little pluses you get for actually having been around a long time. One of the first arbitrages I did involved a company that offered cocoa beans in exchange for their stock. That was in 1955. I bought the stock, turned in the stock, got warehouse certificates for cocoa beans and they happen to be a different type but there was a basis differential and I sold them.

It almost closed. It was chaos. In mid-August 1991, when we were at Salomon, on a Sunday we were within half an hour of seeking out a Federal judge and handing over the keys and filing for bankruptcy. The lawyers were drafting the bankruptcy documents. Fortunately, [the Treasury ruling that would have forced Salomon to seek bankruptcy protection] was reversed. But what would have happened if we\\\\u2019d filed? Coincidentally, Gorbachev was spirited away the same day [Monday, August 19] and the Dow was down a few hundred points. What would have happened when the markets opened in Japan if Salomon Japan couldn\\\\u2019t deliver securities, etc.? Plus, Salomon had a $600-700 billion derivative book. Munger: It could have been absolute chaos. There\\\\u2019s a very interesting story, with an interesting moral. Nick Brady was Treasury Secretary at the time. He was a Berkshire shareholder because of his long relationship with the Chaces. [From Buffett\\\\u2019s 1991 annual letter: \\\\u201cMalcolm G. Chace, Jr., now 88, has decided not to stand for election as a director this year. But the association of the Chace family with Berkshire will not end: Malcolm III (Kim), Malcolm\\\\u2019s son, will be nominated to replace him. In 1931, Malcolm went to work for Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates, which merged with Hathaway Manufacturing Co. in 1955 to form our present company. Two years later, Malcolm became Berkshire Hathaway\\\\u2019s Chairman, a position he held as well in early 1965 when he made it possible for Buffett Partnership, Ltd. to buy a key block of Berkshire stock owned by some of his relatives. This purchase gave our partnership effective control of the company. Malcolm\\\\u2019s immediate family meanwhile kept its Berkshire stock and for the last 27 years has had the second- largest holding in the company, trailing only the Buffett family. Malcolm has been a joy to work with and we are delighted that the long-running relationship between the Chace family and Berkshire is continuing to a new generation.\\\\u201d] Munger: He [Nicholas Brady] knew about us and was following the story. He trusted you, Warren, and I think that mattered. It was terrifying what could have happened that day. Buffett: Kim Chace, who I introduced you to earlier [at the beginning of the meeting, Buffett introduced all of Berkshire\\\\u2019s directors], his father introduced me to Nick Brady when I was in my 30s. [In 1991,] he was head of the Treasury and they had issued a death sentence to us [Salomon] that morning. Fortunately Nick reversed it. [Had he not, we would have filed for bankruptcy and] it would have been a case study for a daisy-chain type of panic. That was nothing compared to what would happen now. It\\\\u2019s not an experiment that you would want to voluntarily conduct, let\\\\u2019s put it that way.

It tells the whole story of our involvement; it is kind of an interesting story. I got the really serious call about LTCM on a Friday afternoon that things were getting serious. I know those people most of them pretty wellmost of them at Salomon when I was there. And the place was imploding and the FED was sending people up that weekend. Between that Friday and the following Wed. when the NY Fed, in effect, orchestrated a rescue effort but without any Federal money involved. I was quite active but I was having a terrible time reaching anybody. We put in a bid on Wednesday morning. I talked to Bill McDonough at the NY Fed. We made a bid for 250 million for the net assets but we would have put in 3 and 3/4 billion on top of that. $3 billion from Berkshire, $700 mil. from AIG and $300 million. from Goldman Sachs. And we submitted that but we put a very short time limit on that because when you are bidding on 100 billion worth of securities that are moving around, you don\\'t want to leave a fixed price bid out there for very long. In the end the bankers made the deal, but it was an interesting period. The whole LTCM is really fascinating because if you take Larry Hillenbrand, Eric Rosenfeld, John Meriwether and the two Nobel prize winners. If you take the 16 of them, they have about as high an IQ as any 16 people working together in one business in the country, including Microsoft. An incredible amount of intellect in one room. Now you combine that with the fact that those people had extensive experience in the field they were operating in. These were not a bunch of guys who had made their money selling men\\\\u2019s clothing and all of a sudden went into the securities business. They had in aggregate, the 16, had 300 or 400 years of experience doing exactly what they were doing and then you throw in the third factor that most of them had most of their very substantial net worth\\\\u2019s in the businesses. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of their own money up (at risk), super high intellect and working in a field that they knew. Essentially they went broke. That to me is absolutely fascinating. If I ever write a book it will be called, Why Smart People Do Dumb Things. My partner says it should be autobiographical. But this might be an interesting illustration. They are perfectly decent guys.I respect them and they helped me out when I had problems at Salomon. They are not bad people at all. But to make money they didn\\\\u2019t have and didn\\\\u2019t need, they risked what they did have and what they did need. That is just plain foolish; it doesn\\\\u2019t matter what your IQ is. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you it just doesn\\\\u2019t make sense. I don\\\\u2019t care if the odds you succeed are 99 to 1 or 1000 to 1 that you succeed. If you hand me a gun with a million chambers with one bullet in a chamber and put it up to your temple and I am paid to pull the trigger, it doesn\\\\u2019t matter how much I would be paid. I would not pull the trigger. You can name any sum you want, but it doesn\\\\u2019t do anything for me on the upside and I think the downside is fairly clear. Yet people do it financially very much without thinking. There was a lousy book with a great title written by Walter Gutman\\\\u2014You Only Have to Get Rich Once. Now that seems pretty fundamental. If you have $100 million at the beginning of the year and you will make 10% if you are unleveraged and 20% if you are leveraged 99 times out of a 100, what difference if at the end of the year, you have $110 million or $120 million? It makes no difference. If you die at the end of the year, the guy who makes up the story may make a typo, he may have said 110 even though you had a 120. You have gained nothing at all. It makes absolutely no difference. It makes nodifference to your family or anybody else. The downside, especially if you are managing other people\\\\u2019s money, is not only losing all your money, but it is disgrace, humiliation and facing friends whose money you have lost. Yet 16 guys with very high IQs entered into that game. I think it is madness. It is produced by an over reliance to some extent on things. Those guys would tell me back at Salomon; a six Sigma event wouldn\\\\u2019t touch us. But they were wrong. History does not tell you of future things happening. They had a great reliance on mathematics. They thought that the Beta of the stock told you something about the risk of the stock. It doesn\\\\u2019t tell you a damn thing about the risk of the stock in my view. Sigma\\\\u2019s do not tell you about the risk of going broke in my view and maybe now in their view too. But I don\\\\u2019t like to use them as an example. The same thing in a different way could happen to any of us, where we really have a blind spot about something that is crucial, because we know a whole lot of something else. It is like Henry Kauffman said, \\\\u201cThe ones who are going broke in this situation are of two types, the ones who know nothing and the ones who know everything.\\\\u201d It is sad in a way. I urge you. We basically never borrow money. I never borrowed money even when I had $10,000 basically, what difference did it make. I was having fun as I went along it didn\\\\u2019t matter whether I had $10,000 or $100,000 or $1,000,000 unless I had a medical emergency come along. I was going to do the same things when I had a little bit of money as when I had a lot of money.If you think of the difference between me and you, we wear the same clothes basically (SunTrust gives me mine), we eat similar food\\\\u2014we all go to McDonald\\\\u2019s or better yet, Dairy Queen, and we live in a house that is warm in winter and cool in summer. We watch the Nebraska (football) game on big screen TV. You see it the same way I see it. We do everything the same\\\\u2014our lives are not that different. The only thing we do is we travel differently. What can I do that you can\\\\u2019t do? I get to work in a job that I love, but I have always worked at a job that I loved. I loved it just as much when I thought it was a big deal to make $1,000. I urge you to work in jobs that you love. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don\\\\u2019t like because you think it will look good on your resume.I was with a fellow at Harvard the other day who was taking me over to talk. He was 28 and he was telling me all that he had done in life, which was terrific. And then I said, \\\\u201cWhat will you do next?\\\\u201d \\\\u201cWell,\\\\u201d he said, \\\\u201cMaybe after I get my MBA I will go to work for a consulting firm because it will look good on my resume.\\\\u201d I said, \\\\u201cLook, you are 28 and you have been doing all these things, you have a resume 10 times than anybody I have ever seen. Isn\\\\u2019t that a little like saving up sex for your old age? There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. When I first got out of Columbia Business School, I wanted to go to work for Graham immediately for nothing. He thought I was over-priced. But I kept pestering him. I sold securities for three years and I kept writing him and finally I went to work for him for a couple of years. It was a great experience. But I always worked in a job that I loved doing. You really should take a job that if you were independently wealthy that would be the job you would take. You will learn something, you will be excited about, and you will jump out of bed. You can\\\\u2019t miss. You may try something else later on, but you will get way more out of it and I don\\\\u2019t care what the starting salary is. When you get out of here take a job you love, not a job you think will look good on your resume. You ought to find something you like. If you think you will be happier getting 2x instead of 1x, you are probably making a mistake. You will get in trouble if you think making 10x or 20x will make you happier because then you will borrow money when you shouldn\\\\u2019t or cut corners on things. It just doesn\\\\u2019t make sense and you won\\\\u2019t like it when you look back.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"I cannot buy See\\\\u2019s Candies in Bonn Germany.

Clearly GS has lost reputation. What is your reaction to the lawsuit, its affect on your GS investment, and what advice you have now for GS based on your experience at Solomon?\", \"answer\": \"WB: Abacus was made subject of SEC complaint (22pages) and I think there has been misreporting on the nature of the transaction. I would like to clarify this transaction, as it is important and frequently mischaracterized. In the Abacus transaction, there were four losers. GS didn\\\\u2019t intend to lose but did, they couldn\\\\u2019t sell their piece. The main loser was a very large bank in Europe named ABN Amro. Why did they lose money? They guaranteed the credit of another company ACA. ABN was in the business of judging credits, deciding credit. They fronted the transaction, guaranteed it. We do it frequently here at Berkshire. Many in business will take a policy if we guarantee the policy. We\\\\u2019ve made a lot of money doing this over the years. We lost a fair amount doing this with some dishonest people in early 1970s. They were syndicates at Lloyds. In Abacus, ABN guaranteed $900m and was paid 17bps of insurance. They got $1.6m for $900m of insurance coverage. The company went broke, so they had to pay the $900m. The bank made a dumb credit deal. It is hard for me to be sympathetic for a bank that made a bad credit trade. ACA, and you wouldn\\\\u2019t know this from the reporting, but they were a bond insurer. They started in municipal bonds, like AMBAC, FSA, etc. Many of those companies started insuring municipal bonds some 30 yrs ago, and it was a big business. But the profits were squeezed. They found new places to insure \\\\u2013 and got into insuring structured credits. I described it a few years ago in the annual report like Mae West, \\\\u201cI was Snow White but I drifted\\\\u201d. Almost all of them did it \\\\u2013 they didn\\\\u2019t understand it well, but made more money. Then they all got into trouble. Is there anything wrong with insuring structured credits? No, but you better know what you are doing. We went into municipal bond business when others got into trouble, we got paid more, and we stayed away from CDOs or RMBS. These deals were too hard. WB: We did insure something. It will help you understand Abacus. This deal [slide up on screen of portfolio of US state bonds] we did insure. A large investment bank came to us. We insure a local power generation company, and the Nebraska Methodist hospital. We have $100m with the hospital. An investment bank came to us, with this list ofnames of states  $1.1b for Florida, $200m for California. Will you insure the bonds of these States that they will pay for the next ten years. I looked at list, and we had to decide a) do we know enough and b) what premium to charge. We insured $160m for 10yrs. On other side, someone is insured that we will pay if they don\\\\u2019t pay. We didn\\\\u2019t come up with list. There are four reasons we were showed this trade. Lehman might own it and simply want insurance, Lehman might be negative on it \\\\u2013 and this is a method to short, they might have a customer wanting protection, or they might have a customer negative on it wanting to short. We don\\\\u2019t care why they wanted the insurance, it was our job to insure the bonds. If they told me Ben Bernanke was on other side of trade, it wouldn\\\\u2019t matter. If it matters to me, I shouldn\\\\u2019t take it. We did with the bonds what ACA did. With list of 120, ACA only accepted 50, then negotiated for 30 more. In Abacus it was a mutual negotiation. Unfortunately, all the bonds went south very quickly \\\\u2013 it wasn\\\\u2019t clear this would happen in early 2007. If you look at how the ABX was trading, it wasn\\\\u2019t obvious. Now there can be trouble in these States bonds we have insured. Maybe the guy on other side knows more than me. But I see nothing, I won\\\\u2019t complain if I lose money. I can\\\\u2019t claim other side had superior knowledge. Central part of the SEC argument is that Paulson knew more about the transaction. In retrospect, it was just a dumb insurance decision. Charlie? CM: My attitude is simple. This was a 3:2 decision by SEC commissioners where they usually decide unanimously. I would have voted with the minority. WB: ACA was a bond insurer, not an investor, pure and simple. Well... simple as it turns out.  The press seems to be misrepresenting the situation by calling ACA a manager. ACA lost money because they were a bond insurer. Ironically, this whole situation has helped BRK\\\\u2019s investment in GS. BRK got $5B in preferred stock (that pays $500M per year) that GS has the right to call at 110% of par and get rid of the preferred that costs them so much each year. BRK would have to put that money in ST securities if they got it back and every day that GS does not call the stock is money in the bank for BRK. In fact, it amounts to $15 per second. Tick, tick, tick. Don\\\\u2019t want those ticks to go away. He likes that they go on at night when he sleeps. GS would love to get rid of the preferred. They only decided to do it because it was the height of the crisis. The Fed has likely been telling GS that they can\\\\u2019t call the preferred and that has helped BRK. Buffett was hoping that the Fed would be quite tough when it came to allowing the preferred to be repaid. In effect, the recent developments have delayed the calling of the preferred. Now BRK will get $500M a year rather than $20M a year they would get from ST Treasuries. So Buffett loves the investment in GS. There is no question that the allegation alone caused the company to lose some reputation and all the negative press has hurt the company and morale. But this is not remotely fatal or anything like that. GS had a situation with Penn Central 30 years ago and one with Ivan Boesky that hurt. But the allegation of something does not fall into the category of losing reputation. When a transgression is found out about or alleged (His motto in such situations is: get it right, get it out, get it fast, get it over) it can take a while to figure out what went wrong. He does not hold the allegation against GS. If it leads to something more serious then he will re-look at it. But, when he looks at Abacus he sees it as a legitimate transaction. [Q - And the latter half of the question, regarding your investment in GS and your advice to management?] WB: It has probably helped our investment. We have $5bn in preferred stock at 10% (that pays $500M per year). They can call them at 110% of par and get rid of the preferred that costs them so much each year. BRK would have to put that money in short term securities (which might make $20m versus the $500m per year we now own) if they got it back and every day that GS does not call the stock is money in the bank for BRK. Every day, we get paid $15 per second. I don\\\\u2019t want those ticks to go away. Tick tick tick. They go on at night, and on weekends. I love this, I get paid when I sleep. Tick tick tick. They only agreed to this at the height of crisis, and they want them to go away. The government has been telling companies what to do about dividends and preferred shares. Government telling them what to do, and it is good for our shareholders! I was sitting here hoping that the Fed would continue to be quite tough about our preferred. I think recent developments have delayed the calling of our preferred. So we\\\\u2019ll continue to get $500m per year instead of $20m. We love the investment. I would expect \\\\u2013 there is no question that the allegation alone causes the company to lose reputation and obviously the press has hurt the company, and morale. It isn\\\\u2019t mortal, but it hurts. GS had a situation with Penn Central railroad  that hurt forty years ago. There was a Boesky connection \\\\u2013 it was painful at the time. But an allegation of something doesn\\\\u2019t fall into my category of permanent damage. My advice is that when some transgression is found or alleged  Ron Olson was manager of team [at Solomon], \\\\u201cGet it right, Get it fast, Get it out, Get it Over\\\\u201d. It does take some delays at the time, you have to gather the information and make sure it is right. An allegation has been made. Perhaps it turns into something more serious. But I do not see anything in Abacus that looks any different than our list of municipals. The allegation does not meet my criteria of losing reputation. CM: I agree with all of that. But every business ought to decline business that is otherwise acceptable or legal. Standards shouldn\\\\u2019t be what is legal, but it should be different. Every investment bank took skuzzy customers. There are too many skuzzy customers and too many skuzzy deals. WB: Should we have done our deal? CM: I think it was a closer case than you do. WB: We insure about $140bn of muni bonds. We aren\\\\u2019t bigger because we think the premiums aren\\\\u2019t the right price. Some people when premiums are wrong get busier \\\\u2013 do more. We don\\\\u2019t, we go golfing. We think much is wrong on Wall Street. But our experience with Goldman goes back 44 years.We\\\\u2019ve bought more businesses through them than anyone else. We trade with them as well. We don\\\\u2019t use them as investment advisors \\\\u2013 we make our own decisions. When we trade, they could be selling or buying for their own account. They don\\\\u2019t owe us a rationale or reasoning, nor do we owe them. They are acting in a non-fiduciary capacity when they are trading with us. If working on a transaction or financing, that is different. We have had a lot of very satisfactory business with Goldman. The first bond issue we did was 1967, on slide 2, an offering of Diversified Retailing Corp, $5,500,000. We were imaginative calling it diversified even though we only owned one business. NY Securities and Nebraska Securities were the underwriters. Usually the lead underwriter was at the top. We were having trouble raising the $5.5m. I called Gus Levy and Al Gordon at Kidder Peabody. No one wanted to give us the money. Both Gus Levy and AL Gordon said we\\\\u2019ll take a big piece. GS and Kidder were next largest underwriters, they asked us to leave their names off the tombstone. But they did come through for us, under an assumed name. Al Gordon died last year at 107, worked until 104. Gus Levy was a remarkable man.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"On Goldman, if Lloyd Blankfein had to leave, who would you like to see run GS, were you made aware of the Wells notice, was it material, and would you have disclosed it?

Of course this could be adjusted if there was a huge change in interest rates. Utilities often get 12% ROE. Railroads go to returns on invested capital. I don\\'t think this is a crazy standard. Railroads, unlike the electric utilities where you are guaranteed a rate of return, are more volatile due to the risk of large economic contractions. If you behave yourself in electric utility, you will almost always make your returns. Railroads have more up and down, more downside. In general, you want railroads investing a lot more than depreciation to improve the transportation system. 10.5% is inducement enough. CThe country as a whole and the railroad systems have a common interest in not earning a huge profit but generating a fair return that allows for continued investment. If Service Transportation Board says 10.5%, that is not a crazy number. Munger: Railroads have been regulated successfully. They have been totally rebuilt over the last 30-40 years through improved tracks, bridges - the average train is twice as long and twice as heavy. By and large a system of wise regulation and wise management allowed this. That was not always the case.

Five years ago, virtually everyone thought home prices couldn\\\\u2019t go down. Home prices always go up [it was widely believed]. There was an almost total belief that house prices would rise. They [the ratings agencies, investors, etc.] just didn\\\\u2019t understand the various things that can happen in a bubble with $20 trillion in total assets. People leveraged up their biggest asset enormously. As it began to melt down, it became self-reinforcing. They [the ratings agencies] would have been criticized [if they\\\\u2019d bucked prevailing wisdom]. Taking a different view 4 \\\\u2013 5 years ago might have led to Congressional committees asking how they could be so un- American as to take such a dim view of American homeowners. Ratings agencies and the American people made terrible mistakes. So did Congress and regulators. I never made a call to Moody\\\\u2019s regarding their procedures. When we own stock, we don\\\\u2019t own them [companies] to change them. We\\\\u2019ve had very little luck when we\\\\u2019ve tried to change companies. Ratings agencies are still a good business. It\\\\u2019s a business with few people [companies] in it, it doesn\\\\u2019t require capital, and it has the fundamentals of a good business. They won\\\\u2019t be doing the [previous] volume in capital markets for awhile. Charlie and I pay no attention to ratings. We don\\\\u2019t outsource credit analysis. Munger: Ratings agencies eagerly sought models that let them use higher math and make the decisions they wanted to make. To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Buffett: The people who stirred up the Kool-Aid drank it. It was stupidity, and everyone else was doing it. I send out letters to managers every couple of years: If you\\\\u2019re doing [something] because everyone else is, that\\\\u2019s the wrong reason. That\\\\u2019s not an acceptable excuse at Berkshire. We couldn\\\\u2019t get Salomon to stop doing business with Mark Rich [who Buffett likened to Al Capone in the 1930\\\\u2019s].

Moody\\\\u2019 s stake is being sold, has the investment case changed?] WB: We won\\\\u2019t discuss what we will or won\\\\u2019t do with our securities. Agencies have a wonderful business. Good pricing power, no capital required. People will need ratings agencies. They succumbed to same mania that infected everyone \\\\u2013 it is hard to think contrary to the crowd. They couldn\\\\u2019t see a world where residential housing countrywide could collapse. Incentive may have been bad, but also it is just difficult to think contrary to the crowd.

Turning around a retailer that has been slipping for a long time would be very difficult. Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around? Broadcasting is easy; retailing is the other extreme. If you had a network television station 50 years ago, you didn\\'t really have to invent or being a good salesman. The network paid you; car dealers paid you, and you made money. But in retail you have to be smarter than Wal-Mart. Every day retailers are constantly thinking about ways to get ahead of what they were doing the previous day. Retailing is like shooting at a moving target. In the past, people didn\\'t like to go excessive distances from the street cars to buy things. People would flock to those retailers that were near by. In 1996 we bought the Hochschild Kohn department store in Baltimore. We learned quickly that it wasn\\'t going to be a winner, long-term, in a very short period of time. We had an antiquated distribution system. We did everything else right. We put in escalators. We gave people more credit. We had a great guy running it, and we still couldn\\'t win. So we sold it around 1970. That store isn\\'t there anymore. It isn\\'t good enough that there were smart people running it. It will be interesting to see how Kmart and Sears play out. They already have a lot of real estate, and have let go of a bunch of Sears\\' management (500 people). They\\'ve captured some savings already. We would rather look for easier things to do. The Buffett grocery stores started in Omaha in 1869 and lasted for 100 years. There were two competitors. In 1950, one competitor went out of business. In 1960 the other closed. We had the whole town to ourselves and still didn\\'t make any money. How many retailers have really sunk, and then come back? Not many. I can\\'t think of any. Don\\'t bet against the best. Costco is working on a 10-11% gross margin that is better than the Wal-Mart\\'s and Sams\\'. In comparison, department stores have 35% gross margins. It\\'s tough to compete against the best deal for customers. Department stores will keep their old customers that have a habit of shopping there, but they won\\'t pick up new ones. Wal-Mart is also a tough competitor because others can\\'t compete at their margins. It\\'s very efficient. If Eddie sees it as impossible, he won\\'t watch it evaporate.

Book value is not a great proxy for intrinsic value and it is not a substitute. Berkshire was not worth book value in 1965, intrinsic value was below book value, now the business is worth a great deal more than book value. Book value is not a bad starting point for Berkshire when trying to calculate intrinsic value. We generally do not look at book value when evaluating a stock. - [Re: How would Warren value Berkshire?] I\\\\u2019d think about what\\\\u2019s there, what are they trying to do, what\\\\u2019s it worth if they don\\\\u2019t succeed in deploying additional capital, and what it\\\\u2019s worth if they do. What are the resources available to keep adding to the collection of businesses? I think you\\\\u2019ll find the information [in the annual report] that you need to evaluate Berkshire. Don\\\\u2019t take it out to 4 decimal places. If Charlie and I had to write down a number, it would be different but in the same ballpark. What Berkshire will be worth 10 years from now will depend on earnings, the quality of those earnings and the liquid assets we have. We keep working on it, but we\\\\u2019re so big. There\\\\u2019s no way in the world we can replicate the past, but hopefully we do a reasonable job. [CM: Quickly get rid of the no-brainer decisions. Just go through the cash and investments, which are easy to value. The insurance operation is very interesting and look at the way the cash is deployed.] I don\\\\u2019t think we\\\\u2019ll hit any home runs under any circumstances. A normal level of cash for Berkshire might be about $10 billion. Because of the catastrophe-insurance business we\\\\u2019re in, we don\\\\u2019t scrape the bottom of the barrel [in terms of cash reserves]. We might temporarily dip below $10 billion \\\\u2013 about one year\\\\u2019s worth of earnings, incidentally \\\\u2013 but we don\\\\u2019t need anything like $40 billion. We\\\\u2019d be much happier if we had the excess invested in things we love. I think, according to the 10-Q, we have $37 billion in cash [$37.675 billion, to be precise], not counting the finance businesses, and we spent $4 billion on Iscar and we\\\\u2019re spending on some other things. We\\\\u2019d like very much to spend down to $10 billion and we spend all of our time on this. We have one idea at present that could take up to $15 billion of cash, but it\\\\u2019s a low probability. We\\\\u2019ll get more choices in the utility area. While we don\\\\u2019t like having excess cash, we like doing dumb deals even less because we\\\\u2019re stuck with them forever. You\\\\u2019re right that we should be uncomfortable that we have this cash, but [the alternative of doing bad deals is far worse]. I think it\\\\u2019s likely, but far from certain, that three years from now we will have significantly less cash and hopefully far more earnings power. We love having $4 billion in Iscar rather than it sitting around in short-term bonds. You\\\\u2019re right to keep jabbing us, but we jab ourselves. Neither one of us likes having cash. We\\\\u2019re the biggest player in the world in catastrophe insurance, and people come to us because we\\\\u2019re so liquid, but we don\\\\u2019t need so much cash. We spent $3.5 billion at the Berkshire level in PacifiCorp. Come back next year and I hope we have less cash. [CM: Compare Berkshire 10 years ago to today. Despite much difficulty putting cash to work, we\\\\u2019ve bought a lot of great things and we\\\\u2019re not altogether gloomy about how things are going. [Translation: He\\\\u2019s doing handsprings about how Berkshire is doing!]] - Intrinsic value is simply the sum of all future cash flows a business generates between now and judgment day, discounted back at the proper rate. But that\\\\u2019s pretty nebulous. To value the businesses we own presently, we try to give you information to make a reasonable judgment about that. We own securities, which are easy to value, and operating businesses. We try to give you the information we use to value them. Since Berkshire retains all of its earnings, it becomes very important to evaluate what we\\\\u2019ll do with earnings over time. If you\\\\u2019d looked at the intrinsic value of Berkshire in 1965, we had a textile business worth $12 [per share], but that wasn\\\\u2019t all. You had to evaluate not only the business, but also the skill with which retained earnings would be used. It\\\\u2019s the same situation today: we will put to work billions of dollars this year and in the future. If we do this effectively, each dollar has a value of more than $1. We have $80,000 [per share] in marketable securities. If our insurance business breaks even, that\\\\u2019s free to us. We\\\\u2019re trying to add to our collection of operating businesses and they\\\\u2019ll add to earnings. If Charlie and I wrote down our estimates of Berkshire\\\\u2019s intrinsic value, they wouldn\\\\u2019t be exactly the same, but they would be close. - [Q - what do you think about the market\\\\u2019s valuation of Berkshire shares? The stock price is off more than the decline in Berkshire\\\\u2019s operations.] Buffett: You put your finger on something. We think our investments are worth more than they\\\\u2019re carried for. [If you] leave out insurance earnings from underwriting, last year and this, earnings power was below normal. We have good businesses overall. A few have problems, but many will do fabulously well. It\\\\u2019s okay to look at Berkshire as two parts: securities, and non-underwriting earnings power. We hope both will increase over time. Berkshire is cheaper in relation to intrinsic value at the end of 2008 than 2007. That\\\\u2019s true of most companies. Our focus is for operating earnings to rise. Everything is affected by everything else in the financial world. Munger: Last year was a bad year for a large \\\\u201cfloat\\\\u201d business. But long term, having float that you\\\\u2019re getting at less than free will be a big advantage. Some buyer bought 10,000 Berkshire shares at the absolute peak. Our casualty insurance is probably the best in the business. [So are] our utilities. Iscar is better than others. Down the list, we have extraordinary businesses, and it\\\\u2019s not easy to collect the best businesses, but we think we\\\\u2019ve done it. If you think it\\\\u2019s easy to get in Berkshire\\\\u2019s position, you are living in a different world than the one I inhabit. Buffett: The insurance business is a remarkable business. In the September 2008 meltdown, people started behaving differently, like a bell had been rung. It hurt jewelry, carpet, NetJets. But the phones started ringing at GEICO. Thousands more came to the website to save money. Saving $100 became important. We added 665,000 policyholders in 2008, and [we added] 505,000 in [just] January through April 2009. GEICO is the low-cost producer of auto insurance. It builds a lot of value over time. We had 2 \\\\u2013 5% market share when Tony Nicely took over; 8% now.

Of course capital isn\\'t free. It\\'s easy to figure out your cost of borrowing, but theorists went bonkers on the cost of equity capital.

You have come through at about 24%. That is a big gap of 9% between your modesty and the outcome. Why is there such a big gap?\", \"answer\": \"I don\\'t think it was modesty. For one thing, we\\'ve had a terrific market that has reappraised all businesses in the last 10 or 15 years. So when we really started worrying about future performance, the key factor was having larger amounts of capital. There\\'s no question that the larger the amount of capital, the harder the job is. We were fortunate that that ascension in capital happened to coincide with things that just lifted all the boats substantially. We have had better luck than I would have guessed we would have had 10 years ago. It\\'s been aided by a huge tailwind, and absent that tailwind we wouldn\\'t have done as well. We won\\'t have that tailwind in the future, I can assure you of that, but we will have a larger amount of capital. If Charlie and I could make a deal to increase the intrinsic value of Berkshire by 15% a year over the next 10 years, we would sign up now. I don\\'t want you to even tempt us with lower numbers. If we paid no dividend at all over a 10 year period, you can figure out where a 15% rate would take us. We hope to get there, but we think that is absolutely tops. When the market starts underperforming businesses, the rate could be very substantially lower than that. [CM:\\\\u00a0 Well, the questioner came from Singapore which has perhaps the best economic record in the history of developing an economy and therefore he referred to 15% per annum as modest. It\\'s not modestit\\'s arrogant. Only someone from Singapore would call it modest. (laughter)] Be careful, Charlie, or we\\'ll have a voice vote that we should move to Singapore. This is a group that wants performance. Large sums of money aren\\'t going to compound at super rates. Anybody that manages large sums of money that promises or implies that they can achieve really outstanding returnsI\\'d stay away from them. The numbers just get too big. You\\'ve seen some of that with certain money management organizations in recent years. 15% on an intrinsic value which is substantially greater than our book valueit gets to be a very, very big number. We need huge ideaswe don\\'t need thousands of ideas. I mean, we might need them, but we could never come up with them. What we look for is the very large idea. But we\\'re not finding them now. We\\'ll keep looking, and every now and then we will find something. If you think you have any chance of doing better than 15%and believe me, that\\'s not a number I would want to sign my name toyou\\'re going to disappointed in Berkshire. We don\\'t want to disappoint you, so that\\'s the reason we try to be realistic about expectations. - I think (and Charlie does too) that Berkshire\\'s value has grown significantly over past few years. Intrinsic value is the stream of cash from now until judgment day, discounted based on consideration of other uses. You have to understand what kinds of businesses you can make a reasonable assessment of. At Berkshire, you have two questions: 1) what its businesses are worth now, and 2) what we do with the capital. 35 years ago, people underestimated what we would do with the capital. But we\\'re now in a whole different game, with lots more capital.

It was always interesting to me that everyone read Graham, and they didn\\'t misread him, it\\'s just that they didn\\'t like following him. In terms of not paying dividends, we don\\'t pay dividends because we think we can turn every dollar we make into more than a dollar in market value. The only reason for us to keep your money is to make it worth more by us keeping it than it would be worth if we gave it to you. That\\'s the test, if we come to the conclusion that we can\\'t do that, we should distribute it to you. The interesting thing is we have certain businesses, See\\'s Candy being one, where we don\\'t have a way to intelligently use all of the money that See\\'s generates within See\\'s candy company. So if See\\'s were a stand-alone company, it would pay very large dividends, not because it had a dividend paying policy, but because it wouldn\\'t have a way of using, in this case, $30 million a year in intelligently expanding that business. We hope that in the overall Berkshire Hathaway scheme of things, that we can intelligently use the money that the companies in aggregate generate for us and we think so far we have, and we think the prospects are reasonably good that we can continue to do that. But dividend policy should really be determined by that criteria, also keeping in mind the possibilities of repurchasing stock. If Coke had paid no dividends, and simply repurchased shares and developed the bottling system, the shareholders probably would have been even better off. They\\'ve been sensationally well as it is, but they probably would have been even better off than they have been with the dividend policy they have. And that\\'s true for Gillette and Disney...

Retailing is a business where you have to be smart forever: your competitors will always copy your innovations. Buying a network TV station in the early days of television required you to be smart only once. In that kind of business, a terrible manager can still make a fortune. Given the choice between the two (a business where you have to be smart forever or one where you have to be smart once), Buffett advised, pick the great business - be smart once.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"What\\\\u2019s the cheapest form of financing for Berkshire Hathaway?

Indexing has worked out to be way more popular than anybody ever thought it would be ten or fifteen years ago, including ourselves. The amount of money going into index funds keeps going up; if you added Berkshire Hathaway to the S&P 500, there would be an instant market order for six or seven percent of the outstanding shares immediately - something like 100,000 shares a day. That wouldn\\\\u2019t be good; the price of the stock would go up, but no one would buy it. It wouldn\\\\u2019t be right to add the stock to the index, then not let it be bought. One solution: if it was added to the index, we could sell shares to absorb demand and neutralize the effect of the incremental demand. The problem is, we don\\\\u2019t want to sell equity just to be in an index. Maybe we could do something like what has been done in Australia: phase in the weighting over a twelve-month period. That would result in a market order for 100,000 shares a month, something more manageable. S&P has never done something like that before, but if indexing continues to grow, they\\\\u2019ll have to do something like that. Something that you ought to take note of - many companies do worse after being added to the S&P index. When a stock gets added, there\\\\u2019s an artificial demand for the stock that just can\\\\u2019t last forever. Shorting the stocks that get added can make you money, after they take that initial jump. [CM: My guess is that Berkshire Hathaway will eventually be added to the S&P 500.

If it does [require capital], then we add a charge for the cost of capital. We don\\'t have one compensation system. We\\'ve never had problems with compensation. If capital is an important part of business, we include a charge for it. If not, if we don\\'t. Our compenastion systems are simple. This is not rocket science [though Corporate America seems to make it so]. Read proxy statements  it\\'s mind-boggling the complexity. Compensation consultants have to earn their fee [by coming up with a complex plan that they can] tweak each year. It\\'s becomes an industry and it won\\'t break itself up. True of any bureaucracy. We could spend $1 million per year on something we could figure out in five minutes. Can you imagine a consultant giving you a one-page compensation agreement? They couldn\\'t charge you a lot of money for that. The main reason we get good results from our managers is that they like batting .400. Yes they like the pay, but it\\'s incidental. It has to be fair, but that is not a complicated procedure. It\\'s tailored to things under their control. Some of our businesses are easy, so they much achieve high performance before [the CEO\\'s] bonus kicks in. In tough businesses, lower performance requires as much hard work, so the hurdle is lower. Morale is pretty good in Berkshire subsidiaries. Berkshires managers hardly ever leave. In 38 years, we\\'ve never had a CEO leave to work for a competitor. We face one management succession problem roughly every 18 months.  [CM: As the shareholders know, our system is different from most big corporations. We think it\\'s less capricious. The stock option system may give extraordinary rewards to some people who did nothing, and give nothing to those who deserve a lot. Except where we inherit it [a stock option program], we don\\'t use it.] We inherited stock options, primarily with Gen Re. Those options turned out to be quite valuable. Would not have been if Gen Re had been a stand-alone. Not to criticize anyone, but some people made a lot of money who contributed nothing. Options are a royalty on the passage of time. They put management\\'s interests contrary to the interests of shareholders. We believe in tying incentives to things under management\\'s control. To give a lottery ticket to someone who runs 1% of Berkshire is really crazy. We saw more crazy stuff in the 1990s than in the previous 100 years. There was wealth transfer that has never been experienced before. I\\'ll accept lottery tickets, but they would have no impact on my decisions or behavior. A properly designed option system, tied to performance, can be sensible. But to just pass them out, give a 10-year ride and grant more if the stock goes down, doesn\\'t make sense. [CM: If we\\'re right, then it has considerable implications. [It would mean that] more than 99% of corporate compensation systems are more than a little crazy. We\\'re not against vast rewards for people who deserve them, but [most stock options programs don\\'t achieve this.]] We love to see people at Berkshire making money, but only if they\\'re making money for you. Compensation is an interesting subject and I\\'m going to write about it next year. It\\'s not a market system. Compensation people say it\\'s like baseball negotiation [between a team owner and a star player], but it\\'s not. The player is negotiating with someone who\\'s paying the money. But at large corporations, on one side is guy who really cares and on the other side is the compensation committee  generally people who are not picked for their strong spines  to them, it\\'s play money. It\\'s almost meaningless to the guy on one side if the CEO gets 100,000 shares of restricted stock or one million, but the guy on the other side cares a lot. You get parity in negotiations with unions  that\\'s real negotiation. I\\'ve never seen a compensation consultant say that the Board should reduce the CEO\\'s salary or get rid of this bozo. They\\'d never get hired again. It\\'s a bad system and needs improvement. There have been some improvements. It [improvement in this area] is the acid test of corporate reform. Over time, a vast disparity in pay has arisen, and there\\'s a disconnect between performance and pay. So arise, shareholders!  You could make a lot of money working for Berkshire, but it will relate to performance.  No-one\\\\u2019s going to make a lot of money for average performance. We have some extraordinary management at MidAmerican [Energy Holdings].  In terms of compensation, there are two key individuals [David Sokol and Greg Abel].  For their compensation, I took a yellow pad, sketched out a proposal in two minutes, talked to Walter Scott (who\\\\u2019s our partner in this business) and when he said it looked OK, talked to the managers.  The only change was that we had more than 50% of the rewards going to the CEO, David Sokol, and he said to make it 50/50. Charlie and I spend a couple of minutes [designing compensation plans].  It\\\\u2019s not highly complex, but you have to understand the business.  No one formula can work \\\\u2013 that would be asinine.  Take Chuck Huggins at See\\\\u2019s \\\\u2013 he\\\\u2019s had the same plan for 30 years.  For GEICO, there are two variables [that determine compensation] for Tony Nicely on down. [From Buffett\\\\u2019s 1996annual letter, the two are: \\\\\"Today, the bonuses received by dozens of top executives, starting with Tony, are based upon only two key variables: (1) growth in voluntary auto policies and (2) underwriting profitability on \\\\\"seasoned\\\\\" auto business (meaning policies that have been on the books for more than one year).  In addition, we use the same yardsticks to calculate the annual contribution to the company\\'s profit-sharing plan.  Everyone at GEICO knows what counts.\\\\\"] We do not bring in compensation consultants and we don\\\\u2019t have a human resources department, legal department, etc.  That makes life way to complicated, and people get vested in going to conferences. In some businesses, like network television, you\\\\u2019ll earn a huge return on equity even if your nitwit nephew runs it (as long as you keep him out of the office).  But other businesses are the opposite. You should charge some cost of capital.  Measure the key metrics, set a hurdle and only pay for adding value [above this hurdle], even if the returns appear low [but would have been a lot lower without the value the manager added].  If you had a group of network television stations, you would have 35% pretax margins if a chimp ran it, so you\\\\u2019d only pay for excess above this.  It would be silly to have 10% or 15% hurdle, but a bad manager will try to get this. In the end, if you have a great manager, you want to pay them very well. [Our approach to compensation] is wildly different from the approach of most companies, which go through elaborate procedures.  The typical corporation has a compensation committee, and believe me, they don\\\\u2019t ask Dobermans to be on it; rather, they want Chihuahuas who\\\\u2019ve been sedated. I\\\\u2019ve been on 19 boards and only been asked to be on one compensation committee \\\\u2013 and they regretted it.  [In that case, because I opposed the compensation plan,] I was outvoted \\\\u2013 by two smart, honorable people, by the way. I\\\\u2019ve never seen a compensation consultant say: \\\\u201cThis bozo you\\\\u2019ve got [the CEO] is only worth half what you\\\\u2019re paying him.\\\\u201d It\\\\u2019s an unequal negotiation [between the board and the CEO].  The CEO really cares, but to the board, it\\\\u2019s play money.  It\\\\u2019s hard for board members \\\\u2013 they just get handed a piece of paper showing what the top quartile of comparable CEOs get paid, so there\\\\u2019s a ratcheting effect.  In this kind of system, things will quickly get out of whack.  There\\\\u2019s some change now, but it\\\\u2019s not being led by CEOs.

If I die first, all my stock goes to my wife.  She might put it in the [Buffett] foundation then, or it\\\\u2019ll go there when she dies.  It has approximately 30% of the votes.  By law, the foundation would have to get down to 20% within five years. I think Berkshire has a far better chance than any major company of maintaining its culture [when Charlie and I are gone].  The people running it have grown up in the culture.  My wife and son are there [on the board] as guardians of the culture. A great example [of how this can work] is Wal-Mart when Sam Walton died.  The Walton family has done a magnificent job of hiring successors to run the place and maintain the culture.  The Waltons are there to step in if needed, but they don\\\\u2019t run the business.

Buffett did not answer the question \\\\u2013 perhaps because it was not the appropriate forum (the shareholder could have gotten in line and asked the question during the Q&A period) \\\\u2013 but I think the answer is quite simple: Buffett is increasingly sensitive to making Berkshire a role model for good corporate governance (it always has been, but appearances are especially important these days).  Hence, Berkshire added a number of world-class independent board members this year.  However, Buffett also wants to be sure that Berkshire\\\\u2019s unique culture is maintained forever, and he trusts his wife and son to ensure this more than anyone else.]\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Succession at Berkshire?\", \"answer\": \"When we pass, nothing will change, but there will likely be a hiatus of sorts where people might not have the same feelings about selling their business to Berkshire.

[Regarding a shareholder\\\\u2019s idea of naming a COO today:] I don\\\\u2019t think it works well to have a half-and-half arrangement. We don\\\\u2019t need an operating guy \\\\u2013 we have people running the businesses and the main thing is not to destroy or damage the spirit they have.

[Laughter] If we thought there was some better way to make this place run better or ease the transition, we\\\\u2019d do it, but I don\\\\u2019t think there is. The person [who would take over] knows the business, knows how to make good deals, and knows how to avoid other kinds of deals \\\\u2013 which is equally important. Once it [the transition] happened, Berkshire might even be stronger than before because people would realize that it wasn\\\\u2019t just about an individual. Even though Sam Walton died, Wal-Mart has become a stronger company. In our shareholder letter and in this meeting, [we try to make clear what our culture is]. We want managers to join us who believe in what we do and make a lifetime commitment to join us. Once they join us, we want to act consistently and be consistent. They see that it works. There are plenty of people who don\\\\u2019t believe in our culture and they don\\\\u2019t join us. It would be bad to have a mismatch. The nice thing about it is that our culture is so well defined that there are rarely mismatches. We don\\\\u2019t have any formal training for our culture \\\\u2013 it isn\\\\u2019t really necessary. If I died tonight, there are three replacements. Any of them would not miss a beat in leading this culture.

This is our job in insurance and investments. Many people are very smart, but are not wired to think about things that haven\\\\u2019t happened before. [In response to another question on the same topic:] We\\\\u2019re looking for one or more people \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s entirely possible that it could be three or four people. We\\\\u2019re not looking for someone to teach \\\\u2013 we\\\\u2019re looking for someone who knows how to do it. We received about 600-700 applications, including one guy who recommended his four-year-old son. We\\\\u2019re heard from lots of good people, but the key is whether they could do it running $100 billion. We want to find someone who can run large sums of money mildly better than the market \\\\u2013 and I emphasize mildly because there\\\\u2019s no way anyone can beat the S&P 500 by 10 percentage points per year [running such a large amount of money]. It isn\\\\u2019t going to happen. But a few percentage points per year is possible. Anything times zero is zero and I don\\\\u2019t care how good the record is in every other year if one year there\\\\u2019s a zero. We\\\\u2019re looking for someone who is wired in such a way as to see risks that haven\\\\u2019t occurred and be cognizant of risks that have occurred. Charlie and I have seen guys go broke or close to it because 99 of 100 of their decisions were good, but the 100th did them in. We want to give them each a chunk of about $5 billion and have them manage it for a period of time, as if they were managing $100 billion. Then [after watching them and evaluating them for a while], we\\\\u2019d turn over the entire portfolio to one or more of them. Munger: It reminds me of the young guy who went up to Mozart and said, \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019d like to write symphonies.\\\\u201d When Mozart said, \\\\u201cYou\\\\u2019re too young,\\\\u201d the young man replied, \\\\u201cBut you were young when you started.\\\\u201d Mozart pointed out, \\\\u201cYes, but I wasn\\\\u2019t asking anyone else for advice on how to do it.\\\\u201d Buffett: We\\\\u2019ll find some people. I had to do this years ago when I decided to close the Buffett Partnership in 1969 and had to recommend to my investors where they should put 100% of their money. There were many, many investors with great records, but I chose Charlie, Sandy Gottesman, and Bill Ruane. Charlie wasn\\\\u2019t interested in more partners, but Sandy Gottesman took some individual accounts and those investors have been very happy. Bill Ruane set up a separate mutual fund [the Sequoia Fund], which has also done very well. So, I identified three people who were conservative, where there was no chance at all that they\\\\u2019d blow up, who were not only terrific investors, but also terrific stewards of capital who would treat investors right. They were my age, which helped \\\\u2013 I now have to look at people in a generation where I don\\\\u2019t know many people. In 1979, I picked Lou Simpson for GEICO. I\\\\u2019d never met him but once I did, it was clear that he\\\\u2019d get an above-average result and there was no chance of a bad result. [Buffett published Simpson\\\\u2019s spectacular record on page 18 of his 2004 annual report, showing that Simpson had compounded at 20.3% annually from 1980-2004 vs. 13.5% for the S&P 500.] I have a job to do and I\\\\u2019ll do it. - [Q - Can you provide an update on the succession plan?] WB: We have three CEO candidates who could step in. The Board will pick someone for CEO. For investment officer, the Board has four names. As we\\\\u2019ve discussed, any one, or all four, would be good or better than me at this job. Any one of the four would be here tomorrow if I died tonight. They are all reasonably young, and all well to do. Compensation is not a major factor. Any of the four would come. There\\\\u2019s no reason to come now. I worked for Ben Graham, but in the end I wanted to make the decisions. I prefer to make my own decisions. It is better in this case. When I\\\\u2019m not around to make decisions the Board will decide how many to use. They will be heavily influenced by the incoming CEO, by how he wants to work with them. There will be no gap. They could easily have a better record than my recent record. CM: We still have a rising young man here named Warren Buffett. I think we want to encourage this rising young man to reach his full potential. WB: On the corporate America aging issue, I think we are doing fine. Our average age is 80, so we are only aging at 1.25% per year \\\\u2014 the lowest rate of aging in corporate America. If you have a 50-year-old management team, they age 2% every year.

This was taken nearly word-for-word from his 2002 annual letter, so I\\\\u2019ve just reprinted this section from that letter below.] If such questions were asked every year \\\\u2013 or better yet, every quarter \\\\u2013 there would be a lot fewer accounting problems\\\\u2026They should be asked and the answers should be put into the record.  It would have a very helpful effect.  It puts the auditors on the line.  I\\\\u2019ve been on many boards and in retrospect many things went by that I wish the auditors had brought to my attention\\\\u2026I noticed that in Google\\\\u2019sOwner\\\\u2019s Manual, it said that if the numbers are lumpy when they come to us, they\\\\u2019ll be lumpy when we report them to you. Excerpt from 2002 Berkshire Hathaway annual letter: The Audit Committee Audit committees can\\\\u2019t audit. Only a company\\\\u2019s outside auditor can determine whether the earnings that a management purports to have made are suspect. Reforms that ignore this reality and that instead focus on the structure and charter of the audit committee will accomplish little. As we\\\\u2019ve discussed, far too many managers have fudged their company\\\\u2019s numbers in recent years, using both accounting and operational techniques that are typically legal but that nevertheless materially mislead investors. Frequently, auditors knew about these deceptions. Too often, however, they remained silent. The key job of the audit committee is simply to get the auditors to divulge what they know. To do this job, the committee must make sure that the auditors worry more about misleading its members than about offending management. In recent years auditors have not felt that way. They have instead generally viewed the CEO, rather than the shareholders or directors, as their client. That has been a natural result of day-to-day working relationships and also of the auditors\\\\u2019 understanding that, no matter what the book says, the CEO and CFO pay their fees and determine whether they are retained for both auditing and other work. The rules that have been recently instituted won\\\\u2019t materially change this reality. What will break this cozy relationship is audit committees unequivocally putting auditors on the spot, making them understand they will become liable for major monetary penalties if they don\\\\u2019t come forth with what they know or suspect. In my opinion, audit committees can accomplish this goal by asking four questions of auditors, the answers to which should be recorded and reported to shareholders. These questions are: If the auditor were solely responsible for preparation of the company\\\\u2019s financial statements, would they have in any way been prepared differently from the manner selected by management? This question should cover both material and nonmaterial differences. If the auditor would have done something differently, both management\\\\u2019s argument and the auditor\\\\u2019s response should be disclosed. The audit committee should then evaluate the facts.If the auditor were an investor, would he have received \\\\u2013 in plain English \\\\u2013 the information essential to his understanding the company\\\\u2019s financial performance during the reporting period?Is the company following the same internal audit procedure that would be followed if the auditor himself were CEO? If not, what are the differences and why?Is the auditor aware of any actions \\\\u2013 either accounting or operational \\\\u2013 that have had the purpose and effect of moving revenues or expenses from one reporting period to another? If the audit committee asks these questions, its composition \\\\u2013 the focus of most reforms \\\\u2013 is of minor importance. In addition, the procedure will save time and expense. When auditors are put on the spot, they will do their duty. If they are not put on the spot . . . well, we have seen the results of that. The questions we have enumerated should be asked at least a week before an earnings report is released to the public. That timing will allow differences between the auditors and management to be aired with the committee and resolved. If the timing is tighter \\\\u2013 if an earnings release is imminent when the auditors and committee interact \\\\u2013 the committee will feel pressure to rubberstamp the prepared figures. Haste is the enemy of accuracy. My thinking, in fact, is that the SEC\\\\u2019s recent shortening of reporting deadlines will hurt the quality of information that shareholders receive. Charlie and I believe that rule is a mistake and should be rescinded. The primary advantage of our four questions is that they will act as a prophylactic. Once the auditors know that the audit committee will require them to affirmatively endorse, rather than merely acquiesce to, management\\\\u2019s actions, they will resist misdoings early in the process, well before specious figures become embedded in the company\\\\u2019s books. Fear of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s bar will see to that.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Berkshire\\'s board and corporate governance?\", \"answer\": \"[CM: We\\\\u2019re out of step. We don\\\\u2019t feel the need to have directors from every diversity category and pay everyone $100,000-$200,000 per year.

We\\\\u2019ve been waiting for our system to spread and we\\\\u2019ve been losing. (Laughter)] The real issue is mediocrity \\\\u2013 there are too many .240 hitters on boards. Businesses often settle for a notch or two above mediocrity \\\\u2013 there are strong human instincts at work. For many directors, the director\\\\u2019s fees are an important part of their [total annual] compensation, and they want to be recommended for other boards, so this makes it difficult to arrange a rump meeting to say, \\\\u201cThe guy at the end of the table [the CEO] is no good.\\\\u201d This is mediocrity that is tough to combat. We\\\\u2019ve been on boards and they can only tolerate a certain amount of obnoxiousness, so we have to ration it out. (Laughter) It\\\\u2019s hard to overrule someone [the CEO] and we\\\\u2019re likely to lose anyway. Occasionally we fire a bullet, but it often does no good.

They just don\\\\u2019t behave as if they own it.

(Laughter)   [RE: Majority Voting and Corporate Governance] Munger: I don\\\\u2019t think it\\\\u2019ll have any effect at all on the ethics in corporate boardrooms. There are fads and fashions. I don\\\\u2019t think the troubles will be fixed by something like that. Buffett: In the boardroom, it\\\\u2019s partly a business situation and partly a social situation. The key is: Do they think like owners and, even if they do, do they understand enough about business that their decisions are any good? We\\\\u2019ve been on many boards and I\\\\u2019ve never seen any difference in behavior based on the nature of the votes that got them there. But I think you\\\\u2019d be blown away by the difference in savviness and whether people think like owners. There are all these fashions on corporate governance, but the key job of the board is to hire the right CEO, keep him from overreaching, and exercise independent judgment on important acquisitions. Even smart CEOs are motivated by other than rational reasons when it comes to acquisitions. Directors have not done well in these three areas over time. The only cure to better corporate governance is if very large shareholders zero in on these things. If they focus on other issues, they\\\\u2019ll have fun and get in the papers, but won\\\\u2019t make a difference. But if the largest shareholders say, \\\\u201cThis compensation plan doesn\\\\u2019t make any sense\\\\u201d and withhold their votes for directors, that will make a difference. I just found out that some big institutions are even farming out their voting to someone else. I was amazed. They don\\\\u2019t want to think like owners and we all pay the penalty for that.

For example, suppose that Berkshire writes an equity put option. Berkshire collects the premium and establishes a liability on its balance sheet. The other side of the transaction (the put buyer) creates an asset. Then, both sides mark the option to market. If things move in the buyer\\\\u2019s favor, they show a gain. However, the buyer\\\\u2019s auditors urge them to buy protection for their gain by purchasing a Berkshire CDS, since the buyer\\\\u2019s gain represents a potential receivable from Berkshire. If Berkshire writes a relatively large dollar amount of equity put contracts, the buying of Berkshire CDSs significantly increases\\\\u2014and this demand pushes Berkshire CDS prices higher, which to the casual observer would suggest that there\\\\u2019s increased risk in Berkshire. Got that?

Will you make PacifiCorp accountable? [Problem of green/blue algae, polluting the water and killing the salmon]] WB: The first dam was built in 1907. We are prohibited from commenting on this. There are strong disagreements. DAVID SOKOL [Chairman of MidAmerican Energy, the Berkshire subsidiary that owns PacifiCorp]: It was inappropriate for Mr. Buffett to respond. These four dams on the Klamath River, there are a whole series of issues in the federal regulatory re-licensing process. It will be ongoing for eight years. It won\\\\u2019t culminate for another six years. There are twenty-eight various parties that are party to a discussion about what should or should not happen with these assets. Of these twenty-eight parties, there are four different directions that this process could go. We will be pleased to find a resolution. It is up to the regulatory commission, state legislators, and then each regulator in each state. We are working constructively with each of the parties. We have met with each of the parties, and hope we find an acceptable compromise. WB: Regulators will deal with those issues. When government gets involved in eminent domain, there are always tradeoffs. Overall you have people with widely different interests. A big interest is the cost of electricity. Every commission that makes a decision on coal vs. gas makes a tradeoff, and tradeoffs are partly an economic cost and partly other issues. FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] will listen to everyone. They have to listen to everyone. We will do exactly what they say. We follow the dictates of regulatory bodies. They give us a fair return. From the standpoint of profitability, it is neutral. Society will make the decision. DS: We distributed a study that found an accumulation of bio-algae and microcystin. There are 27 other lakes in Oregon with that type of blue-green algae. It is created from lakes that have a high abundance of nutrients. Klamath is hyper-eutrophic \\\\u2014 there\\\\u2019s a great abundance of algae and nutrients. There are 4 reservoirs. FERC does take it into account. Some do not call for the removal of the dam. All the parties will need to come to agreement. WB: The net benefits vs. losses must be weighed. There are lots of competing ideas and desires in a large society. It is up to the government to sort it out. People are coming to different conclusions about tradeoffs, and generally those are at the state level. The Oregon Public Utility Commission, I am sure, is aware of the issue. They have to consider the best way to generate electricity for the citizens of Oregon. DS: We want to clarify that we are not polluting the water. We recognize the various issues. We have a 50 year FERC license. A societal answer, hopefully, will be reached.

There is Chapter 8 in Graham\\'s Intelligent Investor about the attitude toward stock market fluctuations, that and Chapter 20 on the Margin of Safety are the two most important essays ever written on investing as far as I am concerned.

Let me give you an illustration.  I bought my first stock in 1942.  I was 11.  I had been dillydallying up until then.  I got serious. What do you think the best year for the market has been since 1942?  Best calendar year from 1942 to the present time.  Well, there\\'s no reason for you to know the answer.  The answer is 1954.  In 1954, the Dow \\\\u2026 dividends was up 50%.  Now if you look at 1954, we were in a recession a good bit of that time.  The recession started in July of \\'53.  Unemployment peaked in September of \\'54.  So until November of \\'54 you hadn\\'t seen an uptick in the employment figure.  And the unemployment figure more than doubled during that period.  It was the best year there was for the market.  So it\\'s a terrible mistake to look at what\\'s going on in the economy today and then decide whether to buy or sell stocks based on it.  You should decide whether to buy or sell stocks based on how much you\\'re getting for your money, long-term value you\\'re getting for your money at any given time.  And next week doesn\\'t make any difference because next week, next week is going to be a week further away.  And the important thing is to have the right long-term outlook, evaluate the businesses you are buying.  And then a terrible market or a terrible economy is your friend.  I don\\'t care, in making a purchase of the Burlington Northern, I don\\'t care whether next week, or next month or even next year there is a big revival in car loadings or any of that sort of thing.

In \\\\u201874, you could have written down all kinds of things that would show the future would be terrible. We don\\\\u2019t pay any attention to this kind of thing.

What is a fair valuation? (1997)\", \"answer\": \"If you believe that American businesses in aggregate can earn the kind of returns they have been earning in the past couple of years, and you postulate no change in interest rates, you can justify 7000 on the Dow and 800 on the S&P. Now, if interest rates go higher, the valuation goes down automatically. And, more importantly, if the returns on equity of American industry, which are at historic highs, and which classical economics tells you would be hard to maintainif those returns go down, that also would pull it down. I\\'ll give you a little quiz: What two years has the Dow had the greatest overall gain? The two years in the 1900s are 1933, which most of you don\\'t think of as a banner year, and 1954, and in both of those years the Dow was up over 50%, counting dividends. In March of 1955, because of the fact that the Dow had gone up, they decided to have Congressional hearings about it (laughter), and my boss Ben Graham was called down to testify, and Ben\\'s opening comments about the market at that time were, \\\\\"The market looks high, it is high, but it\\'s not as high as it looks.\\\\\" Which brings about the current situationthe market certainly looks high, but there have been huge changes in earnings and return on equity and you\\'ve had this big move in interest rates. Now those are underlying fundamentals that have powered a huge bull market. After a while, people get captivated simply by the notion of rising prices without going back to the underlying rationale and that\\'s when you get very dangerous conditions in terms of possible developments. I have no idea where the markets will go, but you have the kind of conditions that could cause real excesses, just like you had excesses in 1973-74 in the other direction, when you could buy businesses for 20 cents on the dollar.

You could just think that there would be some sort of leveling effect between 7 and 22, that as savings got directed within the economy, and as the competitive forces operate that we\\'ve been taught will operate over time, will come into play, but I\\'ve been wrong on that subject. Let\\'s say you have a 22% perpetual bond, and let\\'s say a third of that coupon would be paid out. So, a bond with a 22% coupon, and say 7% is paid out, being the dividend payout on the S&P we\\'ll say, and the other 15% is reinvested in more 22% bonds with similar characteristics. Now what\\'s that instrument worth on a present value basis? A lot of money. In fact, it\\'s worth so much that it becomes a mathematical fallacy at some point, because when the compound rate becomes higher than the discount rate you get infinity, and that\\'s a concept we like to think about around Berkshire though we may not attain it. There\\'s a book called The Petersburg Paradox and the Growth Stock Fallacy by David Durant, written about 25 years ago, and it gets into this bit where the growth rate is higher than the discount rate, and it shouldn\\'t work for an extended period of time. Charlie? [CM:\\\\u00a0 I think a couple of things contributed to this phenomenon that we so carefully mispredicted. Number one, it became very fashionable for corporations to buy in shares, and I think that we helped in a very small way to bring on that. I think that was a plus in terms of corporate decision making. The other thing that happened is that the anti-trust administration got way more lenient in allowing people to buy competitors. And I think that those two factors helped raise returns on capital in the United States, but you wouldn\\'t think that could go on forever. What 15% per annum compounded will do is grow way faster than the economy can grow, way faster than aggregate profits can grow over the long haul ... I don\\'t think we\\'ve reached a new order of things where the laws of mathematics have been repealed ... All of you should be aware of this, because all the people who are professional sellers of investment advice and brokerage services, etc., etc., have an immense vested interest in believing that things that can\\'t be true, are true. And not only that, they\\'ve been selected in a Darwinian process to have formidable sales skills and large incomes.

(more laughter)  [Q - Are corporate profit levels sustainable?] Corporate profits as a percentage of GDP are at a record. I\\\\u2019ve been amazed. After being in a range for decades, it\\\\u2019s jumped up. I\\\\u2019d have to look at a chart, but other than maybe a year after World War II, I think there have only been two or three years in the past 75 where corporate profits have been as high [as they are today]. I would not think it would be sustainable. When they get up to 8% or more of GDP, that\\\\u2019s high, but so far there\\\\u2019s been no reaction like higher taxes. You have lots of businesses earning 20% on tangible equity in a world where corporate bonds are yielding 4-5%. That\\\\u2019s astonishing. If you read a book, it would say it\\\\u2019s not possible. This is high, which means someone else\\\\u2019s share is going down, namely labor\\\\u2019s. Does it become a political issue? Congress has power to change this very quickly. Corporate tax rates used to be 35%, but now many companies are paying only 20%. Corporate America is living in a great time. History shows this is not sustainable. I would imagine that it will not be. Munger: A lot of profits are not in manufacturing or retailing, but in financial sectors. There\\\\u2019s been a huge flow of profits to banks and investment banks. That has no precedent. I don\\\\u2019t think it\\\\u2019s ever been as extreme as it is now. Buffett: We\\\\u2019ve invested in and owned banks. If 20 years ago you\\\\u2019d asked me whether it was possible, in a world of 4.75% bonds, that countless banks would earn 20%+ returns on tangible equity, I\\\\u2019d have said no. In part this is due to leverage. A 1.5% return on assets leveraged 15 times is a 22.5% return on equity. But even so, you\\\\u2019d think once everyone was doing it, return on assets would drop to 1%, but it hasn\\\\u2019t happened yet. Munger: Some of this is due to consumer credit, which has been pushed to extremes. Other countries that have done this have suffered bad consequences \\\\u2013 South Korea, for example, really suffered for two or three years. I don\\\\u2019t think this is a time to swing for the fences.

Seriously, you look for the logical things - passion, an interest in running the business, honesty. Such as, do they love the business, or do they love the money? This is the first filter. I mean real passion; Mrs. B ran Nebraska Furniture Mart until she died at the age of 103 - that\\'s passion. If temperament is the most important personal asset in managing money, in business, it\\'s passion. Secondarily, if you\\'ve been doing it a while, you get to know how to do it. But obviously no management team is perfect, so you\\'re often stuck making a judgment call. You don\\'t want to wait forever to find the perfect team. Incidentally, a friend of mine spent twenty years looking for the perfect woman; unfortunately, when he found her he discovered that she was looking for the perfect man. - A shareholder asked how the pair assesses managers at companies in which they invest. Buffett informed the crowd that \\\\u0093\\\\u201ca really good business doesn\\\\u2019t need good management - and a poor business can\\\\u2019t do well no matter how good management a management is. There are enormous differences in the talent of American businesses. The Fortune 500 management doesn\\\\u2019t get picked like Olympic team athletes. In some cases, it\\\\u2019s fairly easy to pick out a good management. We think a .350 hitter will continue to be one; we don\\\\u2019t believe the .127 hitter who says, hey I\\\\u2019m different because I\\\\u2019ve got a new bat. In business, those are often the managements who say they\\\\u2019ve hired consultants. Once we see ability, we like to see how they treat their shareholders. Tom Murphy is a good example of a great manager.\\\\u0094 - Buffett thinks there are two main factors in assessing management: How have their results been?How do they treat the company\\'s shareholders? Look also at how management treats themselves relative to the shareholder by reading the proxy circular.  Buffett later went on to say that one of the two or three most important things a Chief Executive Officer does is to allocate capital (i.e., invest money - either retained earnings or new outside capital). Yet few CEO\\'s are trained for capital allocation because they rose through other streams in the business such as operations, sales or finance. Referring still to capital allocation, Buffett said most CEO\\'s, when they get the top job, are \\\\\"like a concert pianist arriving at Carnegie Hall - only to be handed a violin\\\\\". Often CEOs who are inexperienced in the field of capital allocation will rely on so called \\\\\"experts\\\\\" Buffett sees this as extremely dangerous. - [Q: What do you look for in a manager?] We look for managers that have a passion for their business. We\\'ve had terrific luck with entrepreneurs who love their businesses like I love Berkshire. They\\'ll tell me to butt out if I\\'m going to screw it up. They are part of Berkshire, but guard their businesses jealousy. We got a book from an investment bank from someone who bought a business a few years ago [and now wanted to sell it]. The business was a piece of meat to them. What are the odds that they didn\\'t doctor the books? [I look for people who] have a lot of love for their business. There can\\'t be a company in the country, if you could measure passion for the business, no-one would come close [to Berkshire]. [CM: What matters most: passion or competence that was born in? Berkshire is full of people who have a peculiar passion for their own business. I would argue passion is more important than brain power.] By the time they get to us, if they didn\\'t have brainpower, they wouldn\\'t have gotten to us. We\\'re not going to see an incompetent but passionate manager  those got weeded out a long time ago. But I do have to weed out a manager who just wants to cash out. We see lots of businesses that play games with their accounting and just want to cash out.  Almost everything we learn is from public documents. I read Jim Clayton\\'s book, for example. There is adequate information out there to evaluate businesses. We do not find it particularly helpful to talk to managements. Often managements want to come to Omaha to talk, and they come up with all sorts of reasons, but what they really hope is that we become interested in their stock. That never works. The numbers tell us a lot more than the managements. We don\\'t give a hoot about anyone\\'s projections. We don\\'t want even want to hear about it. - It would be tough to evaluate a class of MBAs and pick which ones would prove to be the best managers, just like it would be tough to pick the best golfer by watching them hit on the practice range. We haven\\\\u2019t tried to evaluate, before they have a record, who will be superstar managers. Instead, we find people who\\\\u2019ve batted .350 for 10-50 years. We just assume we won\\\\u2019t screw it up by hiring them. We take people who play the game very well and allow them to play. I recall a study that correlated business success with the age at which a manager started. It turns out that those who started young did best. Of course, if you work with what you have, you can develop over time, but a lot of it is wiring \\\\u2013 I\\\\u2019ve come to believe more so than I did 4-5 years ago. I\\\\u2019ve never heard Charlie say anything dumb about business \\\\u2013 except when he disagrees with me. (Laughter) And I\\\\u2019ve never heard [GEICO CEO] Tony Nicely say anything dumb about business, ever. [CM: Part of it is intelligence, partly temperament. Rick Guerin, for example, wanted to be rich, he was smart and had the right approach [so I knew he would be very successful]] It\\\\u2019s interesting to think about the odds that the NCAA basketball Final Four will be cancelled [referring to his comment elsewhere that Berkshire had written a $75 million policy on the Final Four being cancelled].

IQ is not really that important. They need to be able to work well with others and the ability to get people to do what you want them to do. I\\\\u2019d say intelligence, energy, integrity. If you don\\\\u2019t have the last one, the first two will kill you. All you have is a crook who works hard. If a person doesn\\\\u2019t have integrity, you want them dumb and lazy. If you could put 10% of your future earnings on one of your classmates, you would pick the one that\\\\u2019s most effective at working with people. These are qualities that are elective. If you could pick one to sell short, it would be the person that no one wants to work with. You can elect to be the kind of person you want to be.

Keeping score doesn\\\\u2019t build organizations, homes, etc. I have never had one fight with Charlie. When I took over Solomon I had to pick the best person to run it. I interviewed 12 people for 15 minutes each and I asked myself, \\\\u201cWho would I go into a foxhole with?\\\\u201d I never look at grades or where you went to school.

It\\\\u2019s basically the same thing.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Your thoughts on management compensation? Management compensation in a cyclical industry?\", \"answer\": \"[RE: Management Compensation in a Cyclical Industry?] Buffett: That\\\\u2019s a terrific question. If you run a copper company and it\\\\u2019s at $3.50/lb., you could be the village idiot and coin money. But if it\\\\u2019s at 80-90 cents/lb., which is what it\\\\u2019s been for most of my life, there can be tough times. We have a wide range of businesses at Berkshire \\\\u2013 some are easy to run and some not. We have a wide range of compensation systems. Most people, left to select their own compensation systems, [will pick one that gives them big guaranteed rewards]. If we owned a copper-mining company in its entirely, we\\\\u2019d base compensation on costs of production, which management has control over, rather than things based on market prices, which they don\\\\u2019t control. Costs won\\\\u2019t fluctuate a lot. Compensation should tie to what is under the control of management. Try to understand what management can have impact on. At GEICO, we measure and compensate management and employees on two factors: unit growth and the profitability of seasoned business. (New business initially costs us money and we want it, so we don\\\\u2019t penalize for it.) If oil is $70 per barrel, I don\\\\u2019t think management has anything to do with it \\\\u2013 in fact, they denied they did in front of Congress. I\\\\u2019d measure the cost of finding new reserves over time \\\\u2013 the ability to discover and extract oil at low unit costs. Some firms are much better at this than others. [RE: Management Compensation in General] Munger: It\\\\u2019s easy to have a fair compensation system like we have at Berkshire. A lot of other public companies have fair systems, but about half have grossly unfair systems in which top management gets paid too much. But our impact on this matter has so far been about zero. Buffett: We have 68 operating companies and I have responsibility for compensation of 40 managers (some have businesses grouped under them). I can\\\\u2019t think of anyone we\\\\u2019ve lost over a 40-year period because of different views on compensation. We\\\\u2019ve never had a comp consultant (maybe at a subsidiary, but they\\\\u2019re smart enough not to tell me [Laughter]). It\\\\u2019s not rocket science. But a complicated, confusing system works to the advantage of people who have their hand on the switch. I was put on one comp committee, and Charlie can tell you what happened... Munger: We were the largest shareholder at Salomon, we were both on the board and Warren was on the comp committee. [When it came time for bonuses, there was] a frenzy of envy. Warren pushed toward slightly \\\\u2013 and I emphasize slightly \\\\u2013 more reasonable compensation and was voted down. Buffett: Charlie used the term envy, not greed. Our experience is that envy is what really drives people. You can give someone a $2 million bonus and they\\\\u2019re happy until they see the next guy got $2.1 million and then they\\\\u2019re miserable. Charlie has pointed out that of the seven deadly sins, envy is the most useless, because you just make yourself miserable and can\\\\u2019t sleep. There\\\\u2019s real upside to gluttony \\\\u2013 I\\\\u2019ve had some great times with gluttony. And we won\\\\u2019t get into lust. [Laughter] Incidentally, the SEC wants more transparency in pay, which is a good idea, but it can become a shopping list. One CEO sees the other getting his haircuts paid for and he wants it too. - Munger: The question is about the unfairness of executive compensation and the effect on investors. Now that you know the question, you can solve it. Buffett: There are more problems with having the wrong manager than the wrong compensation system. It\\\\u2019s enormously difficult to run a big company, so the greater sin is having the wrong person [as CEO vs. overpaying that person]. There is a natural tendency toward rising compensation due to ratcheting, the publicity of what other CEOs get and the lack of intensity of the bargaining process. You read about labor negotiations going on for weeks, both sides declare an impasse, they negotiate until 3 am, etc. When was the last time you heard about anything like this when a board negotiates pay with a CEO? There\\\\u2019s not parity in the negotiating process \\\\u2013 one side really cares and the other doesn\\\\u2019t. Comp consultants know that getting hired in the future depends on a recommendation from the CEO. Under those circumstances, it\\\\u2019s an unfair fight. It\\\\u2019s a joke. I\\\\u2019ve been on 19 boards and they put me on one comp committee \\\\u2013 and they regretted it. They\\\\u2019re looking for cocker spaniels, not dobermans. I try to pretend I\\\\u2019m a cocker spaniel, but nobody\\\\u2019s fooled. [Laughter] What really drives it is envy, not greed. You pay someone $2 million and they might be quite happy until they hear that someone else got $2.1 million. Charlie said of the seven deadly sins, envy is the worst because it makes you miserable. The other guy doesn\\\\u2019t care. Compare this to gluttony, which we\\\\u2019re about to do [referring to the See\\\\u2019s candy in front of them]. I\\\\u2019ve heard good things about lust, but I\\\\u2019ll let Charlie address that. [Laughter] Compensation is not rocket science. We have very simple systems to compensate our people. We don\\\\u2019t make it complicated. We don\\\\u2019t pay them for things that are happening that they have nothing to do with. If oil goes from $30 to $60, there\\\\u2019s no reason to pay [an oil company executive] for that. If they have low finding costs, which they can control, I\\\\u2019d pay them like crazy for that. That is the job you hire them for. To hand them huge checks for something they have no control over is crazy, and it\\\\u2019s equally crazy to penalize them if oil prices go down. If oil prices went down and my CEO had low finding costs, we\\\\u2019d pay him like crazy. Munger: This process has contributed to the rise of comp consultants. It reminds me of the joke about why the woman told the census taker that the man of the house was in jail for embezzlement. Because she didn\\\\u2019t want to admit that her dad was a comp consultant. [Laughter] - [Q -Executive pay - what can we do to get the country and the issue going the right way?] WB: Compensation - you can\\\\u2019t do much. There are relatively few people that could do a lot, by withholding votes. Big shots don\\\\u2019t like being embarrassed and it will make boards of directors sit up and take notice. It would not take many of the big institutions, only a few of the biggest, and the press would do the rest. You want a good press. The press needs material. I don\\\\u2019t know how you create incentives for big institutions to do that. A lot of checklists that institutions use are asinine. Ben Graham bemoaned investors as a bunch of sheep. The press would do the work if they had material, but they won\\\\u2019t respond to you. Small shareholders can write persuasive notes. It takes a real effective pressure to change behavior when self-interest is in their favor. CM: In England, they got taxes up to 90%, so there was no possibility of earning a large income. That was counterproductive. You can get the politics of envy that ruins economics. I think people taking compensation have a moral duty not to take it; a moral duty to be underpaid. If generals and archbishops can do it, why can\\\\u2019t the leaders of a large enterprise take less than the last dollar? That said, it is very difficult to implement. WB: Envy is the silliest [of all the sins], because you feel worse and the other people feel fine; maybe they feel better. Rule out envy as part of your repertoire. Gluttony has some upside, with maybe some temporary side effects. Lust\\\\u2014of course I\\\\u2019ll let Charlie speak to that. [laughter]  [Q - on executive compensation packages in capital-intensive companies.] Buffett: We spend a lot of time talking about compensation in capital-intensive businesses. You must include a capital cost element in a compensation system. See\\\\u2019s Candies needs no capital. We think incentives are very important. Boards have relatively little impact on CEO compensation. The CEO has a big effect on his own compensation. They appoint their own compensation committee members, and CEOs aren\\\\u2019t looking for Dobermans\\\\u2014rather they\\\\u2019re looking for Cocker Spaniels. In my experience, boards have not thought about what to pay these people [CEOs]. There must be incentives to do the right thing and incentives not to do the wrong thing. Boards thinking like owners is ideal. Not every CEO wants a rational compensation policy. Who would, when an irrational system pays more? I don\\\\u2019t think there should be compensation committees. [The board should]: hire the right CEO, and make sure he doesn\\\\u2019t overreach. Boards don\\\\u2019t care as much as the guy on the other side of the table [when it comes to CEO compensation]. Boards have gotten better in recent years, but started from a very low base. Munger: I would argue that liberal pay for directors is counterproductive. It would be better if boards were not paid at all. Buffett: The SEC will question a real owner\\\\u2019s independence. To get business-savvy directors who think like real owners\\\\u2019 representatives on the board is tough. [Board] compensation arrangements are more baloney. If compensation is too high, [the director] is not independent. Highly paid boards aren\\\\u2019t going to argue with the CEO. It gets club-like. [Having] 100-page proxy statements explaining board compensation is wrong. Munger: A director who has a lot to lose is loathe to be independent. [Q - how shareholders can influence executive compensation.] Buffett: The AIG outrage was probably disproportionate, but it doesn\\\\u2019t matter. You can\\\\u2019t legislate compensation. In the early Clinton administration, they legislated a cap on salaries, with unintended results. The Clinton administration attempt to do so was the worst legislation ever and resulted in much higher executive compensation. The result was taxes paid by shareholders and all kinds of counterproductive compensation arrangements. All you need is for the top half-dozen investment managers to speak out against the most egregious executive compensation arrangements. That would change behavior. The way to change big shots is to embarrass them. Directors don\\\\u2019t like to look foolish and see their names in the paper. There is no constraining factor now. Every compensation committee hires a consultant, who raises the recommended compensation. It ratchets up executive compensation. We have the honor system\\\\u2014 shareholders have the honor, and the executives have the system. [laughter] Munger: The manager is like the guy in a glass house throwing stones. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.  [Q - How do you determine management compensation plans at Berkshire?] WB: I try to figure out if I owned the entire business what I\\\\u2019d pay them. This is not rocket science. The seventy businesses we have each have different economics \\\\u2013 we don\\\\u2019t set a standard Berkshire compensation plan. A BNSF needs lots of capital, others could be run by a chimpanzee, while others with Alfred P Sloan as CEO couldn\\\\u2019t run them well. I try to figure out the best strategy \\\\u2013 and we find that managers stay with us. It is not rocket science. But I spend time on it, and it takes ability to differentiate. An HR dept would be a disaster, and they would have people telling them all sorts of different equations. It requires common sense and interaction with managers. We agree on a measure of what they are adding to company. CM: We have opposite system to GE and Army, and it works for us. Practically nobody is like us. It works, and makes us peculiar. WB: I get worried when people agree with us. We have managers that will make tens of millions annually. Everyone wants to be treated fairly. The rationale should be understood, but there is no cross Berkshire rationale. It is ridiculous to put a cost of capital on each business. No difference if 40m or 43m or some other number is used in the business. The real thing is to pay managers for widening the moat that differentiates our business from competitors. I can\\\\u2019t think of a manager who has left us over compensation. CM: Amazing how simple it has been, how little time it has taken, and how well it has worked. Headquarters is typically hated in the field. We don\\\\u2019t want an Imperial headquarters with charges imposed everywhere. We charge for credit, but that is it. Most headquarters charge for costs.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"How important are managers?\", \"answer\": \"We\\\\u2019ve spent many years buying many things without meeting managements at all. The $5 billion of stocks we bought in the first quarter are mostly run by managements we\\\\u2019ve never talked to. We read a lot, 10Ks, etc. If we buy the entire business, we care very much about management and whether they\\\\u2019ll behave in the future as they have in the past. We\\\\u2019ve had good luck with this. But in marketable securities, we read the annual reports. Charlie and I read an annual report recently \\\\u2013 it was very fancy \\\\u2013 for an oil company that didn\\\\u2019t talk about finding costs per MCF [million cubic feet of gas] or barrel [of oil]. The most important metric, over time, wasn\\\\u2019t even discussed and when it was touched on, it was in a dishonest manner. That tells us a lot about the individual running the company. If he\\\\u2019s not willing to talk to the owners, even once a year, that makes me question the person. In marketable securities, however, we\\\\u2019ve still bought into some extremely good businesses run by people we didn\\\\u2019t care for because we thought they couldn\\\\u2019t screw them up. Munger: Two things matter: if the quality of the business is good enough, it can carry bad management. The reverse isn\\\\u2019t true, though. It\\\\u2019s very rare for a great manager to take over a bad business, say the textile business, and make it great. You shouldn\\\\u2019t look for Warrens. Buffett: It took me 20 years [to get out of the textile business]. If you asked me to run a tough business, I wouldn\\\\u2019t do it. It\\\\u2019s too tough. Even the best manager in the world couldn\\\\u2019t fix it.

They don\\\\u2019t have a monetary reason to work in many cases. We have 19 people at head- quarters and 250,000 around the world. Our job is to make sure they have the same enthusiasm. We have to see passion in their eyes and believe the passion will remain, but we can create an environment to keep them happy. At these annual meetings, we tell them what a great job they did and make them feel appreciated. We don\\\\u2019t have contracts \\\\u2014 it doesn\\\\u2019t work. Our managers are appreciated.

Accounting Standards Board suggested doing it one of 2 ways, with first way preferred (expensing options through income statement). 498 companies chose #2. 2 companies took the preferred way.

But if they submit to me, temptation is to fudge to match it in some way. If others thought others were doing it, they would do it. You want structures that eliminate bad behavior, that minimize human weakness. CM: So much of bad behavior comes not from malevolence, but from the subconscious justification of poor decisions as being just part of the system. Best cure is that people that make the decisions bear the consequences. No one felt any responsibilities on Wall Street, for making bad loans sold on to someone else.

We will take Ben Franklin\\\\u2019s ideas and make them entertaining for children\\\\u2019s stories. It is good to have smart learning at elementary level, that is better than advanced degrees at graduate level. CM: I admire McDonalds, which I think has succeeded better as educators than a university where I recently spoke.They were not amused at the comparison. McDonald\\\\u2019s has had a constructive effect on employees who were threatened with not making it. They teach marginal people responsibility.

Mastering accounting is like mastering a new language, it can be so much fun. The attitude should be one of discovery, that you are coming there and discovering.

The most powerful force in the world is unconditional love. To horde it is a terrible mistake in life. The more you try to give it away, the more you get it back. At an individual level, it\\\\u2019s important to make sure that for the people that count to you, you count to them. What if you could buy 10% of one of your classmates and their future earnings? You wouldn\\\\u2019t buy the ones with the highest IQ, the best grades, etc, but the most effective. You like people who are generous, go out of their way, straight shooters. Now imagine that you could short 10% of one of your classmates. This part is usually more fun as you start looking around the room. You wouldn\\\\u2019t choose the ones with the poorest grades. Look for people nobody wants to be around, that are obnoxious or like to take all the credit. If you have a 500 HP engine and only get 50 HP out of it, you\\\\u2019ll be beat by someone else that has a 300 HP engine but gets 250 HP output. The difference between potential and output comes from human qualities. You can make a list of the qualities you admire and those you despise. To turn the tables, think if this is the way I react to the qualities on the list, which is the way the world will react to me. You can learn to turn on those qualities you want and turn off those qualities you wish to avoid. The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken. You can\\\\u2019t change at 60; the time to look at that list is now - I tell college students, when you get to be my age you will be successful if the people who you hope to have love you, do love you. Charlie and I know people who have buildings named after them, receive great honors, etc., and nobody loves them  not even the people who give them honors. Charlie and I talk about wouldn\\'t it be great if we could buy love for $1 million. But the only way to be loved is to be lovable. You always get back more than you give away. If you don\\'t give any you won\\'t get any. Everybody loves Don Keough [former senior executive and Board member of Coca Cola]. There\\'s nobody I know who commands the love of others who doesn\\'t feel like a success. And I can\\'t imagine people who aren\\'t loved feel very successful.

My biggest mistakes were errors of omission vs. commission. Berkshire Hathaway was also a big mistake. Sometimes the opportunity costs of keeping money in something (like a lousy textile business) can be a drag on Berkshire\\'s performance. We didn\\'t learn from the previous mistake and bought another textile mill (Womback Mills) 6-7 years after buying Berkshire Hathaway. Meanwhile, I couldn\\'t run the one in New Bedford. Tom Murphy, my friend, bought the newspaper in Fort Worth. The previous ownership of these entities owned NBC as well, but he wanted to divest the NBC affiliate - $30 million to buy, doing $75 million in earnings. It was really a pretty good company, but he wanted to sell it anyway. There wouldn\\'t be many more of it. Network television stations don\\'t require excessive brains to run. They add a lot of money to our bottom lines. We have never lost lots of money in things, except in insurance after 9/11. We don\\'t do the kinds of things that lose you a lot of money. We just might not be finding the \\\\u201cbest\\\\u201d opportunities. Don\\'t worry about mistakes. You\\'ll make mistakes. Get over it. At the same time, it\\'s important to learn from someone else\\'s mistakes. You don\\'t want to make too many mistakes.

[Q - Sometimes we learn more from our failures than our successes. What do you consider your greatest mistake or failure?] I have made lots of failures of omission more than failures of commission. Things that I understand, there have been a few, a couple that cost $10B. If a business was selling cheap and I did not buy, I consider that a failure. As Charlie would say, I was sucking my thumb on that one. I made a terrible deal buying Dexter Shoe. I did not learn much from it either. I bought it for $400M, but the biggest mistake is that I gave up stock that is now worth $3B. You\\\\u2019re going to make mistakes. You can\\\\u2019t play in the game without making any mistakes.

So you have twenty-four hours, you figure out what the social rules should be, the economic rules and the governmental rules and you and your kids and their kids will live under those rules. You say, \\\\\"I can design anything? There must be a catch?\\\\\" The genie says there is a catch. You don\\'t know if you are going to be born black or white, rich or poor, male or female, infirm or able-bodied, bright or retarded. All you know is you are going to take one ball out of a barrel with 5.8 billion (balls). You are going to participate in the ovarian lottery. And that is going to be the most important thing in your life, because that is going to control whether you are born here or in Afghanistan or whether you are born with an IQ of 130 or an IQ of 70. It is going to determine a whole lot.What type of world are you going to design? I think it is a good way to look at social questions, because not knowing which ball you are going to get, you are going to want to design a system that is going to provide lots of goods and services because you want people on balance to live well. And you want it to produce more and more so your kids live better than you do and your grandchildren live better than their parents. But you also want a system that does produce lots of goods and services that does not leave behind a person who accidentally got the wrong ball and is not well wired for this particular system. I am ideally wired for the system I fell into here. I came out and got into something that enables me to allocate capital. Nothing so wonderful about that. If all of us were stranded on a desert island somewhere and we were never going to get off of it, the most valuable person there would be the one who could raise the most rice over time. I can say, \\\\\"I can allocate capital!\\\\\" You wouldn\\'t be very excited about that. So I have been born in the right place. Gates says that if I had been born three million years ago, I would have been some animal\\'s lunch. He says, \\\\\"You can\\'t run very fast, you can\\'t climb trees, you can\\'t do anything.\\\\\" You would just be chewed up the first day. You are lucky; you were born today. And I am. The question getting back, here is this barrel with 6.5 billion balls, everybody in the world, if you could put your ball back, and they took out at random a 100 balls and you had to pick one of those, would you put your ball back in? Now those 100 balls you are going to get out, roughly 5 of them will be American, 95/5. So if you want to be in this country, you will only have 5 balls, half of them will be women and half menI will let you decide how you will vote on that one. Half of them will below average in intelligence and half above average in intelligence. Do you want to put your ball in there? Most of you will not want to put your ball back to get 100. So what you are saying is: I am in the luckiest one percent of the world right now sitting in this roomthe top one percent of the world. Well, that is the way I feel. I am lucky to be born where I was because it was 50 to 1 in the United States when I was born. I have been lucky with parents, lucky with all kinds of things and lucky to be wired in a way that in a market economy, pays off like crazy for me. It doesn\\'t pay off as well for someone who is absolutely as good a citizen as I am (by) leading Boy Scout troops, teaching Sunday School or whatever, raising fine families, but just doesn\\'t happen to be wired in the same way that I am. So I have been extremely lucky so I would like to be lucky again. Then the way to do it is to play out the game and do something you enjoy all your life and be associated with people you like. I only work with people I like. If I could make $100 million dollars with a guy who causes my stomach to churn, I would say no because in way that is very much like marrying for money which is probably not a very good idea in any circumstances, but if you are already rich, it is crazy.I am not going to marry for money.

So I really don\\'t  I don\\'t want to be in a position where I am leveraged or something of the sort that does keep me up at night.

We just had to get things straightened out.  And we\\'re well on the way to having that happen. - The most dramatic way we protect ourselves is we don\\\\u2019t use leverage.

If you read what Adam Smith  wrote in 1776 about specialization of labor, you know, he said if you need to deliver a baby, don\\'t try to learn to do it yourself.  Get an obstetrician.

[Q - which part of this incredible act was most important or most concerning to you and why?] I actually gave the stock away 15 years ago in my mind, created a trust mentally. When my wife died, I was forced to do something. Soon after I discussed my plans with Bill and Melinda they gave me an original copy of Adam Smith\\\\u2019s Wealth of Nations.

Mike Tyson doesn\\\\u2019t try to run Berkshire, and I don\\\\u2019t try to get in the ring with Mike Tyson. This is how I look at philanthropy. I started looking for people that were younger, smarter, more experienced, and doing it with their own money. I looked for people that had similar goals, who would do the best with the money. In effect, I outsourced the handling of my philanthropy. It was a no brainer. In the Fortune article, I stated that business is a game that I love because I get to hit the easy pitches. Ted Williams had written a book about hitting and he said to succeed in baseball, you had to wait for the best pitch. See\\\\u2019s Candies to me was an easy pitch. It is not like Olympic diving, where one could do a simple dive perfectly, but score lower than someone who might have made a big splash attempting a more difficult dive. In diving you are judged on the degree of difficulty. Philanthropy is the opposite of investing with degree of difficulty. Philanthropy deals with trying to solve the toughest problems in society, so you expect to fail very often. I personally don\\\\u2019t like failing, so I\\\\u2019d rather let someone else do it. I wouldn\\\\u2019t personally enjoy working on something where I couldn\\\\u2019t get any feedback on how I was doing and in fact, expected the project to fail. My lifespan is 12 years now and I should be able to add tens of billions of dollars to my \\\\u201cdonation\\\\u201d in that time. I am going to stick with what I love doing and I am glad others will work on giving the money away. I\\\\u2019m just lucky to have been in the right place at the right time.

I believe that society doesn\\\\u2019t benefit from that, but it does benefit when people are rewarded based on what they do. [CM: Throughout history, lots of people have had much handed to them - and they haven\\\\u2019t always done well with it afterwards.]  [Q - Could you discuss your views on estate planning and how you will allocate your wealth to your children?] It really reflects my views on how a rich society should behave. If it weren\\'t for this society, I wouldn\\'t be rich. It wasn\\'t all me. Imagine if you were one of a pair of identical twins and a genie came along and allowed you to bid on where you could be born. The money that you bid is how much you had to agree to give back to society, and the one who bids the most gets to be born in the US and the other in Bangladesh. You would bid a lot. It is a huge advantage to be born here. There should be no divine right of the womb. My kids wouldn\\'t go off and do nothing if I give them a lot of money, but if they did, that would be a tragedy. $30 billion will be generated from estate taxes, which will go to help pay for the war in Iraq and other things. If you take away the estate tax, that money will have to come from somewhere else. If not from estate taxes then you inherently get it from poorer citizens. Less than 2% of estates will pay the estate tax. They would still have $50 million left over on average. I think those that get the lucky tickets should pay the most to the common causes of society. I believe in a big redistribution. Wealth is a bunch of claim checks that I can turn in for houses, etc. To pass those claim checks down to the next generation is the wrong approach. But for those that think I am perpetuating the welfare state, consider if you are born to a rich parent. You get a whole bunch of stocks right at the beginning of your life, and thus you are sort of on a welfare state of support from your rich parents from the beginning. What\\'s the difference? At $100,000 a year, I can find 10 people to paint my portraits to find the perfect one. I have that kind of money. But that is a waste, as those people could be doing something useful.

If you want to give away all of your money it is a great tax dodge. People should give away all their money because the money could do a lot of good. In the US, if we spend 25% of GDP then we cannot keep taxation at 15% of GDP. Two classy people are heading up the deficit commissionErskine Boles and Alan Simpson.

The federal government collects $30 billion in tax revenue per year from estate taxes and a high percentage of the heirs of these estates will receive $50 million or more. We have to ask ourselves what is the proper tax policy for our society. Let me illustrate with a game. Imagine 24 hours before your birth a genie comes to you and lets you design the world into which you will come. You define all of the political, economic, and societal facets of the world. But there is one catch. You have to draw a ticket from a pool of 6 billion. On this ticket will be your characteristics in this world, i.e. if you are born in the US or Bangladesh, if you are male or female, black or white, retarded or normal, etc. What would you do? You would design a world with rules that would initially foster abundance. A world that produces lots of output where everyone is productive. You would create an abundant society. Secondly, you would want justice. You would want the output to be spread out. You would design a world where there was freedom from fear, freedom from fear of old age. You would want equality of opportunity, a market system, and that the best people were in the right places. You would want a world that would take care of the people who got the bad tickets. This has nothing to do with religion, I\\\\u2019m agnostic. At the time that I was born, the odds were about 50 to 1 that I was born in the United States. I won the ovarian lottery. You would make sure all of the lucky tickets are incentivized to keep working. Also you would want others to have equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome though. One bigger thing would be a good system of the rule of law. You would also want to make sure you have people in the right places according to their talents. You would also want to help others that have no opportunity. I could set it up so that my descendants would not have to work for ten generations. So I would end up effectively taking my descendants out of the pool of proactive people. The descendants of wealthy people could potentially become welfare recipients. Lots of families (I won\\\\u2019t name names) create dynasties where society contributes to them just because they are part of the \\\\u201clucky sperm club\\\\u201d. Instead of using food stamps, they would have stocks and bonds. The estate tax modifies the ability to create a family dynasty that takes the descendants out of the work pool, the group of productive citizens. We all participated in the ovarian lottery, it\\\\u2019s probably the most important thing we have ever done. In fact, you all are in business school, you are pretty smart and you have a bright future ahead of you; if you had the chance to trade in your lottery ticket for the chance to pick 100 tickets of which you would have to take one. Would you do it? I would argue you should not. Out of the 100, only 4 or 5 would be born in the US. Out of that only not many would be headed on the path you are headed down. So we are part of the top 1% in society, we are pretty lucky. My descendants are part of the top 1 tenth of one percent of society. This means that you are in the luckiest 1% of the world. \"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Is all your media exposure the best use of your time?\", \"answer\": \"WB: Probably not.

Because you will learn a tremendous amount about investments, you all have the ability to do well; you all have the IQ to do well. You all have the energy and initiative to do well or you wouldn\\'t be here. Most of you will succeed in meeting your aspirations. But in determining whether you succeed there is more to it than intellect and energy. I would like to talk just a second about that. In fact, there was a guy, Pete Kiewit in Omaha, who used to say, he looked for three things in hiring people: integrity, intelligence and energy. And he said if the person did not have the first two, the later two would kill him, because if they don\\'t have integrity, you want them dumb and lazy. We want to talk about the first two because we know you have the last two. You are all second-year MBA students, so you have gotten to know your classmates. Think for a moment that I granted you the rightyou can buy 10% of one of your classmate\\\\u2019s earnings for the rest of their lifetime. You can\\'t pick someone with a rich father; you have to pick someone who is going to do it on his or her own merit. And I gave you an hour to think about it. Will you give them an IQ test and pick the one with the highest IQ? I doubt it. Will you pick the one with the best grades? The most energetic? You will start looking for qualitative factors, in addition to (the quantitative) because everyone has enough brains and energy. You would probably pick the one you responded the best to, the one who has the leadership qualities, the one who is able to get other people to carry out their interests. That would be the person who is generous, honest and who gave credit to other people for their own ideas. All types of qualities. Whomever you admire the most in the class. Then I would throw in a hooker. In addition to this person you had to go short one of your classmates. That is more fun. Who do I want to go short? You wouldn\\'t pick the person with the lowest IQ, you would think about the person who turned you off, the person who is egotistical, who is greedy, who cuts corners, who is slightly dishonest. As you look at those qualities on the left and right hand side, there is one interesting thing about them, it is not the ability to throw a football 60 yards, it is not the ability the run the 100 yard dash in 9.3 seconds, it is not being the best looking person in the class, they are all qualities that if you really want to have the ones on the left hand side, you can have them. They are qualities of behavior, temperament, character that are achievable, they are not forbidden to anybody in this group. And if you look at the qualities on the right hand side the ones that turn you off in other people, there is not a quality there that you have to have. You can get rid of it. You can get rid of it a lot easier at your age than at my age, because most behaviors are habitual. The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken. There is no question about it. I see people with these self-destructive behavior patterns at my age or even twenty years younger and they really are entrapped by them. They go around and do things that turn off other people right and left. They don\\'t need to be that way but by a certain point they get so they can hardly change it. But at your age you can have any habits, any patterns of behavior that you wish. It is simply a question of which you decide. If you did this... Ben Graham looked around at the people he admired and Ben Franklin did this before him. Ben Graham did this in his low teens and he looked around at the people he admired and he said, \\\\\"I want to be admired, so why don\\'t I behave like them?\\\\\" And he found out that there was nothing impossible about behaving like them. Similarly he did the same thing on the reverse side in terms of getting rid of those qualities. I would suggest is that if you write those qualities down and think about them a while and make them habitual, you will be the one you want to buy 10% of when you are all through. And the beauty of it is that you already own 100% of yourself and you are stuck with it. So you might as well be that person, that somebody else.  First of all, I\\'d say marry the right person. And I\\'m serious about that.It will make more difference in your life.  It will change your aspiration, all kind of things.  It\\'s enormously important who you marry.  Beyond that, I would say that do what you would do if you were in my position, where the money means nothing to you.  At 79, ... I work every day.  And it\\'s what I want to do more than anything else in the world.  The closer you can come to that early on in your life, you know the more fun you\\'re going to have in life and really the better you\\'re going to do.  So don\\'t be driven where you think the last dollar is presently or anything of that sort.  And then also go to work, if possible, for an organization or an individual that you admire.  I mean I offered to go to work for Ben Graham because there was nobody I admired more in the business than him.  I didn\\'t care what he paid me.  When he finally did hire me in 1954, I moved from Omaha to New York and I didn\\'t know what I was getting paid until I got my first paycheck.  But I knew I wanted to work for Ben Graham.  And I knew I would jump out of bed every morning and be excited about what I would do and I would go home at night smarter than I was in the morning.

One century is a speck on the greater timeline, and such an increase in productivity in the standard of living is surely unprecedented. Another noteworthy success of capitalism is that it is surely better than any alternative system at allocating resources and getting the best people to their most appropriate places. Consider this: in 1790, the first global census was conducted; there were 290m people in China, 100m in Europe, and 4m in what is now the U.S. Now the U.S. holds 4.5% of the world\\'s population but is responsible for 30% of global GDP.

Over time, textile mills in other parts of the world were able to operate more efficiently and we simply could not compete. I had to shut the plant down and fire everyone; the workers were casualties of the system. You can\\'t retrain or save those people; they\\'d had it. So the real challenge with capitalism is that you can\\'t throw sand in the gears of greater output but you also want to care for the casualties.

You would try to figure out a system that is going to produce an abundant amount of goods, and where that abundance is going to increase at a rapid rate during your lifetime and your children\\'s and your grandchildren\\'s. You\\'d want some system that turned out what people wanted and needed, and you\\'d want something that would turn them out in increasing quantities for as far as the eye could see. But you\\'d also want a system that, while it did that, treated the people that did not win the ovarian lottery in a way that you would want to be treated if you were in their position, because a lot of people don\\'t win the lottery. I mean, Charliewhen we born the odds were over 30 to 1 against being born in the United States. Just winning that portion of the lottery is an enormous plus. We wouldn\\'t be worth a damn in Afghanistan. We\\'d be giving talks and nobody would be listening. (laughter) It would be the worst of all worlds. So we won in that waywe won partially in the era in which we were born by being born male. When I was growing up, women could be teachers and secretaries and nurses and that was about it. 50% of the count of the country was excluded from a very large part of the occupations. We won it by being white. No tribute to us, it just happened that way. And we won it in another way by being wired in a certain way which we had nothing to do with, that happens to enable us to be good at valuing businesses. Is that the greatest talent in the world? No, it just happens to be something that pays off like crazy in this system. (laughter) When you get through with that, you still want to have a system where the people that are born like Bill Gates or Andy Grove or something get to turn those talents to work in a way that really maximizes those talents. It would be a crime to have people like that or Tom Murphy working in some pedestrian occupation just because you have this great egalitarian instinct. The trick, it seems to me, is to have some balance that causes the people who have the talents that can produce goods that people want in a market society to turn them out in great quantity, and to keep wanting to do it all their lives, and at the same time, takes the people that lost the lottery, and makes sure that just because they got the wrong ticket, they don\\'t live a life that\\'s dramatically worse than people that were luckier. When I get through that long speech, I probably come out with the idea that the capital gains tax as it is today is just about right. I\\'ve been around a lot of people with money and talent over time, they don\\'t always go together but I\\'ve been around both classes (laughter) and I see very few of them that are turned off from using their talents by a 28% capital gains taxit just doesn\\'t happen. They do what they like to do. I\\'ve just never seen it happen. I see a lot of people that pay taxes that are higher than 28% that are contributing more to society by some judgment other than a pure market system. I just don\\'t think it\\'s inappropriate in a country like this to tax me at 28% for selling some of my Berkshire shares whereas somebody who makes even relatively modest amounts of money can get up to 39% while they\\'re trying to figure out a cure for cancer. That\\'s where I come out on that.

Considering US policy is to do nothing until the last second, will we face World War III? Will oil companies go to zero?] WB: Oil won\\\\u2019t run out - it doesn\\\\u2019t work that way. At some point the daily productive capacity will level off and then start declining gradually. There is the depletion aspect and the decline curves. We are producing 86 million barrels per day or so, more than ever produced. We are closer, by my calculations, to almost our productive capacity, than we have ever been. I think our surplus capacity is less, and quite a bit less, than in the past. Whatever that peak is, whether it\\\\u2019s 5 years, 10 years, etc., the world will adjust, and we will think about it. Adjustments will cause demand to taper off. I don\\\\u2019t know how much oil is there, but there are lots of barrels of oil in place. We never recover total potential. We may have better engineering recovery in the future. It is nothing like an on and off switch. You may still have enormous political considerations to get access to available oil since it is so important. There is nothing you can do over a short period of time to wean the world off oil. CM: If we get another 200 years of growth dispersed over the world while the population goes up, all oil, coal and uranium will run out, so we will have to use the sun. I think there will be some pain in this process. I think it is stupid to use up the hydrocarbons of the world so quickly. It\\\\u2019s stupid when there are so few, and limited, alternatives. What should we have done? We should have brought all the oil over from the Middle East in the 1930s and put it in our ground. Are we doing it now? No. Government policy is behind in rationality. If we are to have a prosperous civilization, we must use the sun. WB: Charlie, what is your over/under for oil production in 25 years? CM: Oil in 25 years? Down. WB: If that is true, that is a big number. China is doing about 10 million cars this year, so down in 25 years is significant.  [Q - You speak frequently about future prosperity. How about oil \\\\u2013 when it runs out. Isn\\\\u2019 t it like trying to satisfy a drug addict with Coca-Cola?] WB: Titusville 1853 changed the world. There are 500k producing wells in the US. It contributed to the prosperity of the world. The world will not be dependent on that windfall for next 100 yrs. There will be other free lunches available, whether it be solar or other. Don\\\\u2019t give up on humans\\\\u2019 ability to innovate to face problems that seemed insoluble. We haven\\\\u2019t really started. If you could a point in time to be born, I would pick today. CM will give you something more dire. CM: 150 yrs ago they needed the oil to get ahead. We can get ahead without the oil if we have to, we are advanced civilization. We need gas, coal and oil for chemical feedstock, not warmth or motor vehicles. Freeman Dyson has pointed out that we could go off oil.

We would have missed a chance to buy something for $25 million that is producing $60 million pre-tax now. We don\\\\u2019t want to pass up the chance to do something intelligent because of some prediction about something we are no good on anyway. So we don\\\\u2019t read or listen to in relation to macro factors at all.

People talk about easy money, but it\\\\u2019s not easy on the people who have money. If you invested at these rates when Columbus landed, and didn\\\\u2019t pay taxes, you\\\\u2019d have doubled your money by now! It won\\\\u2019t go on forever, but I\\\\u2019m very sympathetic with people living on a fixed income. Purchasing power is getting eaten away. This will end at some point.

When we run into trouble the blame doesn\\\\u2019t go to the Fed, it goes to Congress.

The World Trade Center attack was about as extreme as you can get without NCB. As an industry, we can pay claims of tens of billions of dollars, but not hundreds of billions. We write a few policies that cover NCB because we can take a loss of a few billion. Most people don\\'t realize that the World Trade Center attack was, by a huge margin, the largest workman\\'s comp loss in history.

It will happen someday. Thousands of years ago, if you wished evil upon your neighbor, you threw a rock, but since 1945, the potential for inflicting enormous harm on a large number of people has increased geometrically. To those who believe the idea that if we solve poverty it will take care of the problem, I\\\\u2019d remind you that the only country to use nuclear weapons on another is us. What holds the danger in check is a lack of knowledge, materials and deliverability. But knowledge is getting more widespread, and materials are too. I don\\\\u2019t know how money attacks this, but I think this should be a top priority, at least for my foundation. There are six billion people and a few percent are really crazy and they would like to do great harm to a lot of people. And only one has to succeed.

More and more people will know how to do damage. Psychotics will wish ill will. Materials and deliverability is the choke point. People generally associate this risk with terrorists and rogue states. But I regard it as a big threat to the future of mankind. We haven\\\\u2019t made much progress and we should be doing everything to reduce access to materials. We have a proposal to reduce the rationale to have big weapons. The world has 6.5 billion people, and it is very likely that twice the number of people wish ill than when the world had 3 billion. We used to just pick up a stone and throw it at our neighbor, so massive damage was limited. Since 1945, everything in the world has changed except how men think. There\\\\u2019s been exponential growth, and we haven\\\\u2019t gotten rid of the nuts. We live in a dangerous world, and it\\\\u2019s getting more dangerous as we go along.

Starting in 1935, we formally took the idea that the government should provide for the elderly. The government has always been there for young, via schools. Perhaps the idea that 65 isn\\\\u2019t the right age for retirement anymore is correct and more change is needed. This country has output of nearly $40,000 of GDP per capita. Some people like Charlie and me are wired to earn a lot in our society, but many people aren\\\\u2019t [and they need to be taken care of in their retirement]. Our country can easily handle the Social Security issue. It astounds me that a government running a $300-400 billion deficit now is worried about a $100 billion deficit decades from now. We produce more every year as we go along. There\\\\u2019s always a debate over how to split the pie, but it\\\\u2019s a huge and growing pie so we can take care of older people.

I don\\\\u2019t think you\\\\u2019ll necessarily see a contraction of credit or the Fed stepping on the brakes. I think you might see an exogenous event, a shock to the system, that causes a huge widening of credit spreads and a cheapening of equities. This would be good for Berkshire because we have money to take advantage of this. In the past, when credit contracted, there was no money around. We tried to buy a bank in Chicago 30 or 40 years ago and couldn\\\\u2019t borrow at all. The only people willing to lend to us were in Kuwait, and would only lend in dinars. That was real credit contraction. The reason the Fed was established was in response to this. We really needed a system where that would not happen. I think the Fed will not by design produce any credit contraction. Munger: The last time we had a credit contraction [in the junk bond crisis in late 2002], we made a quick $3-4 billion. The whole investing world is getting more and more competitive. If we had a big credit contraction, it would really gum up the world. If we had this, especially after a period of excess like we\\\\u2019ve had, we\\\\u2019d get legislation that most of us wouldn\\\\u2019t like. Buffett: Jon Alter, in his book about the Great Depression [The Defining Moment: FDR\\\\u2019s Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope], describes how this country was close to the brink and FDR got any law passed he wanted, as soon as he could write them. It was a good thing in this case \\\\u2013 banks were closing and people were dealing in scrip. In 1998, Long Term Capital Management blew up and you had a seize-up of the credit markets that was not orchestrated by the Fed. People panicked about even the safest instruments. This happened not 100 years ago but less than 10 years ago. There were plenty of smart people with a lot of money, but people panicked in part because they saw others panicking.

The average homeowner will not read line by line of an insurance policy and the agent often won\\\\u2019t explain it. So when something goes wrong, the homeowner wants to be paid. It\\\\u2019s worse when tens of thousands of homeowners are affected at the same time. It\\\\u2019s natural for government to step in and expand what an insurance company thought they were covering, which leads insurance companies to pull out. I can understand the insurance company not wanting to write policies if the words won\\\\u2019t be adhered to, and I can understand the upset homeowner. If I were writing policies, I\\\\u2019d put exclusions in big type, but even so, I\\\\u2019d expect courts and legislatures to extend or even abrogate the terms of the contracts, figuring a guy like me or insurance companies can better afford it vs. the people affected. When you have people around the country subsidize people who suffer from hurricanes in Florida, that gets very tough. It might become so expensive that they want to socialize it, but the guy in Nebraska says \\\\u201cWhy should I subsidize you living in a hurricane path?\\\\u201d It will really become an issue if you have a $100 or $150 billion loss in Florida. This would lead to a huge increase in taxation in Florida, so the state might call on Washington [the federal government] to pay for it. How much should people who are not exposed to risk send to people who choose to have this risk? I think you\\\\u2019ll see a big struggle over this in the next 10 years. I can\\\\u2019t tell you with precision what the Florida legislation says, but the state of Florida has gotten more into the business of insuring citizens than it was before. [Buffett asked Joe Brandon, CEO of Gen Re, to take the microphone and answer the question.] Brandon: Back in mid-January, the Florida legislature met in a special session and passed legislation that is moving a lot of risk in personal lines. It is having a depressing effect on the insurance industry. There is no free lunch. The state and citizens of Florida are taking a lot of risk. It will work out well if the wind doesn\\\\u2019t blow, but odds are that it will. [According to this summary of the legislation, the state has taken on a $12 billion increase in exposure from $16 billion to $28 billion, with the possibility of an additional $4 billion more.] Buffett: The real problem will be with a $100 billion insured loss. The state might have to issue $60 billion in bonds and might go to the federal government and say, \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s not our fault and the entire country should pay.\\\\u201d $100 billion isn\\\\u2019t likely \\\\u2013 Hurricane Andrew, inflation adjusted, was $30 billion \\\\u2013 but if that storm had come through 20 miles north, it could have been. If this happens, we\\\\u2019ll find out if the whole country has, in effect, been insuring Florida. If the federal government throws it back to Florida, they\\\\u2019d have to issue a lot of bonds and raise taxes.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"What\\'s your opinion on global warming? climate change?\", \"answer\": \"Buffett: I believe the odds are good that global warming is serious.

If you have to make a mistake, err on the side of the planet. Build a margin of safety to take care of the only planet we have. Gen Re writes way less business subject to the effects of global warming than does National Indemnity, which writes super-cat policies. We think much more about whether global warming will produce atmospheric changes that will change the frequency and intensity of major storms.

We have written two types of derivatives, and we have insured a swap that pays to someone else in the event of a default on high yield indices. I think we will make significant money.

Probably not, but if Bear [Stearns] had failed, you would have had chaotic conditions. A CDS is a payment by one party to another. When someone loses money on a loan, they\\\\u2019ve lost real money, but there is not a swap of dollars immediately when the loan goes bad. In a CDS, there is an exchange of cash. Whether the counterparties fail [on a massive scale]\\\\u2014I don\\\\u2019t think it will happen. We\\\\u2019ve had enormous collateral payments from one firm to another in this recent crisis.

People are focused on the pricing and quotes for stocks on a daily basis. But you wouldn\\\\u2019t buy a farm and think about what it was worth on a day to day business. Ben Graham wrote about the importance of temperament years ago and everything he said still applies. Most people don\\\\u2019t have the temperament to handle the ups and downs in the market. People who own a farm don\\\\u2019t think that the market and the price is \\\\u201ctelling\\\\u201d them something. What counts is buying a business at a great price and forgetting about it for a long time. Munger: Said he developed more courage when he learned he could handle hardship. Maybe people should get their feet wet with more failure. Buffett: How liquid is my farm? I\\\\u2019m not expecting prices to tell me what to do. There is a lot of interest in investing. What counts is buying a good business at a decent price and forgetting about it for a long, long time.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Warren Buffett FAQ', 'idioma': 'en', 'description': 'Preguntas y respuestas sobre warren buffett y sus estrategias financieras.'}, page_content='{\"question\": \"Is there a way to create synergies between BRK companies to promote solar solutions?\", \"answer\": \"CM: Solar solutions are coming because they are so obviously needed.
